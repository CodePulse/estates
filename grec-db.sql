With people living longer and recessions regularly reminding us that we&rsquo;re not always going to have an easy ride, everyone should have a retirement plan that looks beyond state provision as a reliable source of pension income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our financial advisers have a wealth of experience of helping clients properly plan for retirement and will be happy to guide you through the number of pension savings options available. We&rsquo;ll take the time to understand your circumstances and help you choose arrangements that best suit your needs &ndash; including advice on when you should start making arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estate Capital provide advice on all of the products listed below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Retirement Income Forecasts&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Personal Pensions&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs)&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Small Self-Administered Pension Scheme (SSAS)&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Occupational Final Salary Pension Transfers&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Occupational Money Purchase Pension Transfers&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Pension Fund Consolidation&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Flexi-Access Drawdown Accounts&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Conventional Annuities&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>With Profit &amp;&nbsp;Unit Linked Annuities&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Enhanced Annuities for those with Impaired Health&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Auto-Enrolment Schemes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tax Relief on Pension Contributions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the initial attractions for investing into a pension fund is that all contributions, up to the annual limits, attract tax relief. This means basic rate tax payers only pay 80% for their pension, while higher rate tax payers only pay 60%. The difference is made up in tax relief claimed back from HMRC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers that make pension contributions can also claim full corporation tax relief on payments into directors or staff pension schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tax-Free Compounding Growth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributions into pensions can be invested in a wide range of assets. Pensions can hold simple cash funds all the way to speculative assets. The growth of these assets will be aided by the fact that no capital gains tax applies to pension fund assets &ndash; meaning that pensions grow predominantly tax-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a great benefit of starting to build a pension fund as early as possible. Retirement funds will benefit from the combination of tax relief and tax-free compounding growth. Most of the value in a pension fund at retirement is built up from long-term savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guaranteed Income or Flexible Income</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of options that are now available to people at retirement is wider and more flexible than ever. People can access their retirement savings between ages 55 and 75. Funds can be converted into a guaranteed income for life or retained to provide a more flexible income.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Multi-Generational Inheritance Tax-Free Asset</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People who elect to enjoy a flexible income arrangement are able to pass their funds on their death, to their spouse, children or even grandchildren. Pension funds once seen as retirement assets only are now legacy assets that multi-generations can enjoy free of inheritance tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New Pension Freedoms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2015 the new pension freedoms were introduced, giving pension fund owners far greater flexibility and access than ever before. With these new retirement benefit freedoms comes responsibility to ensure that your largest asset in used wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pension funds can now be converted to cash at retirement in full or in part, fund a flexible level of ongoing income or be passed down to your spouse, children or grandchildren as a legacy asset &ndash; choices unheard of previously. And, with these new choices comes the need for professional advice to guide you through the range of options available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our financial advisers have a wealth of experience helping clients with their pensions and retirement planning. We can help you build and benefit from pension funds. We believe it&rsquo;s important that you to have confidence in your pension arrangements and the peace-of-mind to enjoy life to the full.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Retirement Planning &ndash; About to Retire?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After planning for security and comfort in your retirement, and having spent years building up your nest egg, it&rsquo;s important to get the most from your pension fund.

The executor of a will or administrator of the estate must pay the tax using funds from the estate. Currently, the tax comes at a cost of 40% on anything above the threshold &ndash; making inheritance tax, potentially, the largest tax demand your estate will ever face.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comprehensive Advice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Inheritance tax is sometimes put on the backburner, either because people don&#39;t like to think about what will happen to their estate after they die, or because they don&#39;t believe they need to consider it yet. However, it&#39;s always best to start your inheritance tax planning as early as possible, so you&#39;re privy to the broadest range of options available to you and able to make informed decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a number of factors influencing the value of your estate and the bill that eventually hits your beneficiaries; some comprehensive calculations are required in order to best manage your affairs upon your death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inheritance Tax Exempt Arrangements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Estate Capital can help you decide who you want to offer gifts towards, when you might want to start gifting, and how frequently &ndash; whether you wish to gift directly or use the range of inheritance tax efficient trusts that are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may wish to reduce a inheritance tax liability by considering inheritance tax exempt investments or make provisions for your children to have the means to pay the eventual tax bill through a Whole of Life Assurance. Or there may be charities or political causes you&#39;d like to consider supporting, taking advantage of their exemption from inheritance tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With many options available and careful consideration needed in order to avoid &#39;the voluntary levy&#39;, our advisers will talk you through each of the relevent options and help you understand the benefits to you and your family.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

	('node','page',0,23,23,'und',0,'<h2>Management of Exchange Traded Funds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth in the Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) sector has been remarkable since their introduction in the USA in 1993. The number of ETFs in issue continues to grow every year with 8845 ETFs now available to UK investors. These ETFs track the performance of nearly every stock market, sub sector stock market, bond market and commodity market across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like index tracking passive funds, ETFs offer investors a single investment that replicates the component assets and performance of a selected index.&nbsp;ETFs provide diversification across an entire index guarding against single stock volatility. Management fees are typically lower due to the simple index replication nature of investment research.&nbsp;The index approach benefits from low operating costs and competitive performance when compared to the majority of actively managed investment funds over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are Exchange Traded Funds?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) as the name suggests are funds that trade on a stock exchange. ETFs are pooled investment funds that are regulated under the European Union&rsquo;s UCITS regime allowing ETFs to be bought and sold on all European Stock Markets.&nbsp;ETFs are continuously priced open ended index funds and as such trade throughout the day. An ETF can be purchased at a known price at any time instead of only once a day like OEIC and Unit Trusts. The open ended nature of an ETF also allows for the creation and redemption of shares in order to meet investor demand. ETF trading settlement times are quicker. A sell and buy strategy can be simultaneously executed keeping investors in the market. OEIC and Unit Trusts investors have to wait until a sale is settled to reinvest which usually means four or five days out of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to these characteristics ETFs uniquely provide two sources of liquidity.&nbsp;The primary market offers liquidity through the ETF issuer and Authorised Participants creating and redeeming ETF securities to meet investor demand just like other open ended funds.&nbsp;The secondary market offers liquidity through tradable securities on the stock exchange just like closed end funds.&nbsp;This double layer of liquidity makes ETFs easy to trade and therefore usually track very closely the value of the underlying index.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Index Representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally in order to replicate an index such as the FTSE 100 Index, an index fund would purchase all the underlying physical securities in line with their index weighting. However, this is not always practical so a fund may just buy a range of selected securities. This process is called optimisation and is used when an index is hard to replicate. A fund will instead purchase a representative subset of securities, usually ones that have a strong correlation with the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Purchase</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retail index tracking funds are usually purchased from a fund manager via an investment platform. ETF trade on a stock exchange and therefore are available to buy or sell via a stockbroker or stockbroker platform at market prices. The ETF share price is available throughout the day and is influenced by the share price movement of the underlying securities, currency exchange rate movement for international index funds and investor demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange can be used as an asset within an ISA, Pension Fund or Life Insurance Offshore Bond.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Suitability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ETFs often benefit from lower operating costs and expense ratios compared to OEIC index funds. However, as ETFs are purchased as a security that is traded on a stock exchange they carry additional up front stockbroking purchase costs and a trading spread. Therefore, the holding period of an ETF becomes important in order for the lower annual management costs to overcome the transactional charges. For this reason, ETFs are usually more cost effective for larger lump sum investment. Investors making regular or frequent small contributions would be better suited to OEICs or Unit Trusts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors seeking to create a well-diversified portfolio may be suited to a broad range of ETFs that track the indexes of differing asset classes, sectors or regions. ETFs often hold hundreds or even thousands of individual securities so a single ETF can instantly diversify a portfolio into a particular asset class, sector or region into which the ETF invests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no significant difference in taxation between an ETF and an OEIC, unit trust, investment trust or a share. Realised capital gains count against the capital gains allowance. Dividend income will be taxed as income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For EU UCITS purposes ETFs are often domiciled in Ireland. An Ireland domiciled ETF that has &ldquo;reporting or distribution status&rdquo; for tax purposes is treated for capital gains in the same way as other collective investment funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Due Diligence</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal due diligence processes apply to the selection of an ETF just the same as any other fund we would recommend. Unfortunately, the current level of institutional due diligence reporting is not as extensive as it is for OEICs, unit trusts or investment trusts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is common for an ETF to be selected based upon the relevant index and the operational charges. However, such features as tracking methodology and accuracy, the stability and expertise of the provider, excess return and tracking error as well as the security lending policy should be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annualised fund returns are amongst the first measures considered when evaluating investment funds. How well an index fund performs against both its benchmark index and competing products is also important. The excess return tells an investor the extent to which a fund has outperformed or underperformed against its benchmark index. Tracking error is calculated as the annualised standard deviation of excess return. While excess return measures the extent to which an index fund&rsquo;s returns differ from that of its benchmark, the tracking error indicates how much variability exists within the funds excess return data points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If total return is the primary objective then excess return is more important. However, if a consistent performance that matches the index is important then tracking error is relevant. The best scenario would be an ETF with both a high excess return and a low tracking error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Securities lending is the practise of temporary transferring or lending a security by the ETF manager to a third party in exchange for cash that can produce income for the lender. This can be an attractive source of revenue. However, for what is a relatively risk free way to increase returns there can be pitfalls in the form of counterparty risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Management Costs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Management fees for ETFs are lower than actively managed funds as an ETF simply replicates an underlying index and consequently its performance rather than analysing individual stocks to outperform the index. An ETFs total expense ratio (TER) is typically in the range of 0.1% to 0.6% of asset value per annum. Typically, a portfolio of ETFs would cost an average of 0.3% per annum. Added to this cost are the platform custodial costs of around 0.35% of asset value per annum and the investment management fee. The investment management fee is dependent upon the portfolio investment and varies between 0.35% per annum and 0.75% per annum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Strategies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The world&rsquo;s most advanced market for ETFs is the USA. In the US, ETFs are widely used by institutions, advisers and private investors. With the growth in ETFs we have also witnessed the growth of ETF strategists. These wealth management firms have developed new and differing uses and styles of ETF investment to generate alpha returns form these passive beta products. ETF strategists are overtaking traditional stockbroking firms as the main stay of retail wealth management in the USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, at Estate Capital, wish to be at the forefront of these new ETF strategies in order to improve the range of investment options we offer. With this in mind we are currently investing in new and unique academic research into financial forecasting and market timing strategies in order to launch a series of our own ETF strategies in 2016.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

	('node','article',0,108,108,'und',0,'<p>Interest rates in the Eurozone have reached extraordinary low levels. The highly unusual phenomenon of negative bond yields is now common. For example, the 5 year German bunds have been offering a coupon rate below zero. This situation is intensifying the search for income and consequently driving down yields. Investors, including ourselves, bought European corporate bonds in late 2014 in the belief that the start of the ECB &euro;60bn monthly bond purchasing programme in January would eat up bond supply in Europe leading to scarcity and rising values. The situation was suddenly changed when the ECB QE programme reversed the deflationary pressures in the Eurozone far sooner than expected. The new expectations of inflation forced European bond issuers to respond to the change by offering more attractive higher yields. With rising bond yields come a corresponding fall in bond prices. We have therefore witnessed the early but significant signs of distress in European sovereign bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain is still borrowing heavily and servicing an ever-growing debt pile. If the UK gilt market starts to spike, with yields forced to rise as investors demand higher returns to combat eventual inflation and interest rate rises, this could seriously hit the cost of borrowing and impact the economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the election, the 10 year Treasury Gilt gross redemption yields stood at just under 1.9%. Two weeks later, they broke above 2% for the first time in six months with bond values subsequently falling. This was partly due to the recent rebound in oil prices fuelling inflationary expectations, together with a broad sell-off of Eurozone bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign investors have been selling their UK bonds. Non-residents sold a total of &pound;14bn between January and February. This is part of a wider trend as prices of Western sovereign debt have been inflated by printed money, causing a bond bubble that could burst with inflation and interest rate rises. This is why some bond investors have been leaving the market ahead of a potential loss occurring exit and explains why the European bond market has witnessed significant rises and falls recently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The threat of rising bond yields will have a major impact on western governments not least in the UK. Our public finances remain fragile with borrowing of &pound;87bn in 2014/15 and a national debt of &pound;1.5tr, which nearly doubled over the term of the last parliament. Financing the rising cost of this debt will be challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;After a miserable 2014, the Eurozone is growing&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>After a miserable 2014, the Eurozone is growing. European data has been improving prompting economists to review upwards their growth forecasts. The ECB QE monetary stimulus, lower energy prices and improved bank lending levels have already created inflationary pressure. A big turning point for Europe was the end of the European banking asset quality review. European banks have been under pressure to improve Tier 1 capital ratios. By shoring up capital reserves they cut back on lending to the economy. Now, European banks have been given the all clear and therefore have resumed normal lending and are competing for new business which is leading to falling commercial lending rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination of better lending conditions, lower oil prices, and the depreciation of the Euro by 8% since January has increased European output and exports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retail sales and new car registrations rose at a healthy pace suggesting that energy related savings are being spent not saved. With employment rising and wage growth picking up, we expect further solid spending growth this year and next. Lower borrowing costs will also encourage business investment. It is expected that Eurozone GDP will grow 1.6% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. In fact, Europe may be in better shape than is reflected by current markets as monetary policy takes time to filter through into the real economy. After three years of policy easing and now full QE, Europe may well see stronger economic growth and higher inflation than may be currently expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deflationary fears have moved to inflation expectations, credit is flowing more freely and demand from households and companies are on the rise. Consumer confidence is strong despite concerns over Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past five years European company earnings have lagged behind those of the US as America&rsquo;s growth has powered ahead. This is starting to change which bodes well for European equities. Perhaps the most dramatic transformation is that of the Spanish economy. Recent headlines have been about bailouts, crushing unemployment, high bond yields and bank crisis. Now, it is a growing economy with 2.6% GDP growth this year. Spain will grow almost as fast as the UK and a lot faster than France or Germany. Unemployment, thankfully, is starting to fall as manufacturing and exports are up. There is also good news in Italy. The Eurozone&rsquo;s third largest economy is benefiting from the ECB stimulus package, falling oil prices, and at last the easing of austerity measures. The Italians can expect 0.7% growth this year.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,109,109,'und',0,'<p>The UK general election was predicted to be the most uncertain in decades. In the event it was one of the most certain. The run up to the election did affect market outlook particularly with the realistic possibility of a UK government being heavily influenced by nationalist parties. Sterling has soared after the election on the outcome of a majority Conservative government. Sterling made its biggest gains against the US$ in six years breaking the $1.58 mark and its highest value against the euro in seven years reaching &euro;1.40. This represents great value for British holiday makers this summer but also creates difficulties for UK exporters whose products have become more expensive to overseas buyers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most impressive aspects of the UK economic recovery has been the growth in jobs. Our economy has been a very effective job creator. In the past five years two million extra jobs have been filled while the number of unfilled positions stood at 750,000 at the end of May. Unemployment has fallen over the same period from 8% to 5.5%.

Our employment rate now stands at 73.5% the highest since records began, while the total number of people who are currently unemployed is 1.83 million, the lowest for 7 years. Regular pay awards are now growing at their fastest for 4 years. The annual rate of earnings in the private sector stood at 4.3% while the public sector rose by 0.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest growth sectors have been professional; scientific and technical services, and the high technology sector. Manufacturing employment remains virtually unchanged while construction jobs are surprisingly slightly down. The modern British economy is very service orientated with overseas sales of service almost as big as manufacturing exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain has become an impressive job creator much like the US due to a flexible labour market that supports employment and business friendly economic policies. These features will now remain in place for at least the next five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as UK equity returns are concerned, the FTSE 100 index moved from a 12 month low of 6182 in mid-December to hit a new all-time high of 7103 in late April but has since given up a significant proportion of those gains returning to 6680 in mid-June. The UK index has underperformed many of its global counterparts over the last 9 months largely because the FTSE 100 contains a high proportion of poorly performing mining and energy companies. For example, BP and Royal Dutch Shell were hit by falling oil prices while Anglo American and Rio Tinto were hit by record low iron ore prices. It is for this reason that we remained underweight in the UK over the past six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee has voted again to keep interest rates on hold but has predicted that any pick-up in inflation at the back end of 2015 is likely to put a rate rise back on the agenda. The current rate of 0.5% has now been in place for six years. The last six years have seen real cuts to the incomes of savers. This has had a particular impact on retired savers living off their interest. Mortgage borrowers have benefited as buying a home has never been cheaper from a credit point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This news was announced just before official figures showed that Britain fell into its first period of deflation for 55 years on the back of energy price reductions and an ongoing supermarket price war. The fact that inflation turned negative is not a cause for concern. We are unlikely to see damaging deflation as has haunted Japan over recent decades as inflation is likely to return quite quickly. Oil prices are now around 35% up on their January US$ 48pb low. Global oil supply has been squeezed so prices can now rise again. Q4 could see the combination of rising oil and commodity prices pushing inflation upwards enough to prompt the BoE Monetary Policy Committee into an early review of interest rates. Therefore enjoy the fall in prices while they last.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe BoE is somewhat less optimistic about recovery in Q2 as compared to Q1 and has revised downwards its projections for UK GDP growth. The new forecasts are 2.5% down from 2.9% in 2015 and 2.6% in 2016. The growth forecast has been reduced because of the rise in sterling and the impact that will have on exports, a fall in house construction, and because interest rates may have to rise a little earlier than previously thought. We still expect UK interest rates to stay as they are until Q3 2016 and even beyond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoE is also concerned that many of the new jobs being created are lower skilled and therefore tax revenues may not yet match the rate of growth in job creation. The BoE is expecting workers to become more productive, higher paid resulting in increased tax revenue. We remain optimistic about UK growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government borrowing fell to &pound;6.8bn in April down from &pound;9.3bn a year earlier. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) revised its estimate for a full years borrowing to &pound;87.7bn which is below the government&rsquo;s expectation of &pound;90.3bn. While the deficit has been halved in the last parliament it is still one of the largest in the developed world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Osborne plans to hold a new Budget on 8th July. He is expected to outline his strategy to eliminate the deficit by the end of 2017 and achieve a budget surplus in 2018/19. Perhaps then we can then start to reduce the overall national debt that now stands at &pound;1.487tr representing 80.4% of our annual GDP and costing us all around &pound;52bn per year in interest payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a noticeable increase in bank lending to small business. This is a strong signal that the shortfall of private investment is turning a corner and that credit conditions are improving. Also the number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers has increased amid wider signs of a broader confidence within the UK. In April &pound;7bn of new lending was approved. There was a sharp increase in the amounts savers have deposited into their bank accounts as well as an increase in personal loans. The start of the new tax year in April saw &pound;4.4bn invested in new ISA&rsquo;s and an annual 4.9% increase in personal loan applications. Borrowers are taking advantage of record low interest rates and the signs of economic improvement.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,110,110,'und',0,'<p>Selecting an investment theme that encapsulates the year so far is not a simple task. Financial markets have reacted to the sharpest rise in the US $ for 50 years, the start of large scale quantitative easing (QE) in Europe and Japan, a first quarter slowdown in US growth, a sharp decline and then partial recovery in oil prices, spikes in Eurozone sovereign bond prices and the very real possibility of Greece leaving the Euro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magnitude of these market moving events might explain our prevailing tone of caution as we continue to expect volatility over the next 12 months on the assumption that tighter US monetary policy leads to a rise in bond market and in turn equity market volatility. Again, broad based asset allocation will remain key along with the identification of suitable markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity markets lead by China, India, Japan and Europe hit new highs in Q1. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index returned to levels last seen in the dot com boom of 1999. In the US the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ hit new highs. Meanwhile high quality Eurozone sovereign bonds and corporate bonds moved into negative yield territory before responding to the reversal of deflationary pressure within the Eurozone that pushed yields up and prices down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally we have faith that the world economy is improving aided by European and Japanese QE. For us, equities remain the growth asset along with commercial property. However, as we have witnessed in recent weeks, volatility remains a market feature as stocks have fallen back sharply from their earlier highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several themes will shape the global economy over the next year or so. All of these are supportive of risk assets as economic growth improves, inflation stays low and liquidity remains strong. The challenges for markets will come when the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates, even if this tightening of monetary policy is tempered by ongoing liquidity provision from the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan (BoJ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We felt that at the end of 2014 that the combined impact of lower oil prices and lower interest rates would bring stronger growth and lower inflation in 2015. So far there has been evidence of this but it has been mixed. We have seen positive returns in Europe but so far disappointment in the US. Inflation has fallen in both the US and UK, in fact we have witnessed negative CPI numbers this year whilst Europe has seen an increase in inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slowdown in the energy sector is having a more immediate impact on the US economy than is the boost to consumer spending due to lower energy costs. Very poor weather has also increased energy usage. Nonetheless the fundamentals are in place and with improving income and employment rising, consumption will soon pick up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the start of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the Eurozone and the expansion of QE in Japan, equity growth in these countries has risen in line with that recorded in the US and UK after the start of their respective QE programmes. Part of the current rise in capital values is down to QE but also due to lower energy costs, which have supported growth across the developed world. A stronger US$ and weaker &euro; and &yen; have also skewed growth away from America towards Europe and Japan. It is likely that the Eurozone economy will outpace both the US and UK in the first half of this year. For example, European retail sales volumes are showing a 6% gain year on year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although US growth slowed in Q1, we still expect the Federal Reserve to start raising their interest rates in Q4 this year. This expectation is underpinned by the likelihood of US unemployment rates falling below 5% within the year given the current rate of job growth. There is evidence that wages and employment costs are increasing and while this will not yet translate into higher inflation rates, the Fed does wish to control inflation growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Strengthening US dollar is becoming a significant factor for global growth. The US$ rose 12% in Q1 reflecting growing expectations of US interest rate rises this year. A growing US economy and a strong US$ is good news for exporting economies with US imports up 5% year on year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The strengthening US dollar is becoming a significant factor for global growth&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This broad pattern of recovery in the advanced economies is not extending to emerging markets with the exception of India. The weakness of commodity prices, a downturn in construction and growth in China has influenced emerging markets. An upturn in China is needed to help support a broader emerging market recovery. We expect solid but not spectacular growth from China even though their stock market has had a remarkable year so far. The easing of Chinese monetary policy will cushion a slowdown rather than stimulate growth.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe energy importing emerging markets will benefit from lower oil prices, while the more manufacturing orientated countries in Asia are well placed to benefit from higher consumption in Europe and US. However with the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate rise in the offering there will be increased pressure on emerging markets to finance US$ denominated debt. Therefore focusing on those economies that have strong balance sheets and low external debt like India would be worthwhile. Emerging markets GDP is expected to fall 3.7% this year, the lowest since 2009.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','full_html'),

As the Syriza lead coalition took power in January, Greece was actually starting to enjoy its strongest period of growth since 2008. The economy despite the lack of reform had bottomed and recovery was in progress. It is disappointing to see how quickly that position has been lost. Soon after Alexis Tsipras became Prime Minister, the ECB surprised many by announcing that it would no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral for cheap loans. Greek banks could therefore no longer borrow new money from the ECB, limiting the ECB exposure to Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greece&rsquo;s debt mountain stands at &euro;320bn. The cash strapped government has been struggling since February over the further release of &euro;7.2bn. In June it is due to repay &euro;6.75bn to its principle creditors (ECB, IMF and bond holders), in July &euro;5.95bn and in August &euro;4.38bn. It is the repayment of these loans that are being negotiated without success as yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figures show that private sector bank deposits shrank by &euro;4.6bn in April down to &euro;133bn the lowest since 2004. The people of Greece are withdrawing their savings from their own banks at a phenomenal pace. Since January&rsquo;s general election, &euro;30bn has been withdrawn. So far what has happened is not a full scale run on the banks but it is a fast jog and big enough to cause concern. If Greek citizens take enough money out and banks cannot replace the liquidity with loans from the Bank of Greece then their banks will fail. The ECB are in control of the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). Greek banks have been told that as long as they remain solvent and have adequate collateral they will continue to receive funding. However, with the realistic possibility of Greece leaving the Euro and reinstating the Drachma at a 40%-50% devaluation rate, who would hold their money in Greece?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The likelihood of a forced Greek exit from the Eurozone is higher than ever. It seems clear that Germany in particular is warning Greece &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;. This raises the question of a potential spill over effect into other markets. The risk of default contagion is greatly reduced as compared to the last Grexit threat back in August 2011; Greece is a relatively smaller economy and has greatly reduced its banking sector exposure. The greater risk is a loss of investor confidence but even this has been minimised by the ECB QE programme buying up European corporate bonds. If Greece does exit from the Euro it will be expected that equity and bond markets will see greater global volatility and initial significant losses. However banking contagion should be limited to other peripheral European markets. We do however ultimately expect a classic European and IMF deal to be reached to keep Greece in the Euro, but the chances are reducing by the day as each side becoming more entrenched.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

The combination of freezing conditions, a prolonged dock workers strike and a very strong US$ has led to the world&rsquo;s largest economy contracting by &ndash;0.7% in Q1 compared to an expected 0.2% expansion.

Some economists believe the US economy is running a little hot but consider the recent relapse in Q1 as a temporary blip. Goldman Sachs expects that a surge in delayed imports, low oil prices, low interest rates, high employment and rising wages will see the world&rsquo;s superpower generate further growth. They are predicting a GDP growth figure of 2.9% in Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Department of Labor has confirmed that US unemployment is now 5.5%. This represents a seven year low. Employers in the US created 280,000 new jobs in May on top of the 223,000 new jobs created in April. The March figures were 85,000 which were disappointing, and below expectation, but can be attributed to the seasonally poor weather in the North East. These figures did lead to a fall in US stock values, but the improved April and May figures reversed that decline. While employment growth continues at the current pace, Janet Yellan, the Head of the Federal Reserve, remains on course to raise the federal funds interest rates towards the end of 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an unusual move, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the Federal Reserve to delay any rises in interest rates until 2016 as they believe pockets of vulnerability in the US economy have emerged.

In which case emerging markets will take some comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these signs of growth in the US, we are conscious that American stock markets are currently trading on a price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 27, when the long term mean is 16. We are also mindful that with the wave of cheap money available, equity growth in US corporations is disproportionately being achieved through borrowing, share buy backs, and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) rather than from strong and rising profits. The US is therefore historically overpriced but is enjoying significant momentum due to its status as the first developed economy to emerge from recession.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

With wages and incomes rising, social change and urbanisation is driving a multi-year increase in consumer activity. China is the world&rsquo;s largest importer of oil and therefore should be a net beneficiary of lower energy prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China has reduced its interest rate by 0.25% to a lending rate of 5.1% and a deposit rate of 2.25%. This is the third such reduction in six months following some disappointing results showing weaker than expected exports and foreign trade. Foreign trade fell by 10.9% on a year on year basis as rising labour costs and a relatively strong currency squeezed manufacturing and exports. These rate reductions are therefore aimed at incentivising spending by making it less attractive to leave money in the bank and encouraging business to invest by cutting lending costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data reinforced expectations that China will see its worst annual performance in 25 years. The IMF predict that China&rsquo;s GDP will grow this year at &ldquo;only&rdquo; 6.8%, down from 7.4% last year and greatly reduced from 14.2% in 2007. But, this is a different China and one starting to steer a different course. Government reforms are helping the country transfer itself from an investment and export lead economy to one focused on sustainable but slower domestic consumption lead growth. Economists will agree that 6.8% is still, in global terms, a very attractive growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The volume of trading on China&rsquo;s major exchange has some days reached US$140bn&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the start of the year the Chinese stock market, the Shanghai Index, has risen 37% and its sister index, the Shenzhen is up 53%.

This is four times greater than Wall St. There are 100 million investment accounts in Shanghai as rapid economic growth over the past decade has created a burgeoning middle class wishing to enter equity markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2011 to 2014 the Chinese stock market hardly moved in value compared to China&rsquo;s economic growth. The main reason being the difficulty foreign investment used to have in participating in China&rsquo;s semi-closed stock market and the preference Chinese people had for investing in homes and property. This sector is now in decline as an asset class due to oversupply and higher credit controls on mortgages. The Chinese stock market took off when the property bubble burst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt would be natural to be concerned that with these growth rates the Chinese equity market itself may be heading for a bubble. P/E ratios are currently up to 20 times earnings which is internationally high but still well below the 40 times earnings of 2007. Some sections of the Chinese stock market do qualify for&nbsp;<br />\r\nthe generally accepted definition of a bubble and&nbsp;are being driven by herd instincts and momentum. We are therefore cautious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of new homes in China fell for the ninth consecutive month in May showing that the property sector continues to be a major drag on the world&rsquo;s second largest economy. Average house prices in China&rsquo;s 70 major cities fell by 6.1% so far this year with a very large inventory of unsold property weighing on the market. The property sector accounts for about 20% of China&rsquo;s economy and is now considered one of China&rsquo;s biggest risks to economic growth. The recent rate reductions may help stimulate demand but some economists are calling for a much bigger rate reduction to at least 2% in order to recover demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been reports that China is about to start its own QE programme but in reality this amounts to the People&rsquo;s Bank of China buying local government bonds only. This is targeted financial assistance to revenue squeezed local government. The property turn down has affected local government bond take up rates.

Within weeks of the start of Mr Draghi QE programme, the spectre of deflation was removed with low borrowing costs, rising oil prices, and economic growth. Future inflation was back on the agenda and with this yields soared to compensate investors for the risk of future inflation. With rising yields came falling prices. Government bonds have been on a bull market since the early 1980&rsquo;s on the back of low interest rates. Yields have been exceptionally low and hence bond values have been expensive. This is particularly true if yields are less than inflation or near zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent uplift in oil prices and business growth in the Eurozone particularly in Spain eased fears of deflation which Mr Draghi&rsquo;s programme was designed to prevent. If inflation is to return to Europe, zero bond yields are not acceptable and therefore will have to rise. The normally safe and secure government bond market saw ultra-low yields rising by 20% or more with a corresponding fall-off in value. German Bunds, for example, lost 15% in value in early May. Across Europe, sovereign bonds have seen dramatic rises in yields and resulting falls in capital values representing big losses. The sell-off was described by Goldman Sachs as &ldquo;large and vicious&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bond market re-adjustment could signal the end of a 30 year bond bull market as capital values have kept growing on the back of progressively declining yields due to lowering inflation and interest rates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some good reasons to believe that a bear market in bonds may be premature. Investors have not moved out of fixed interest securities and the Eurozone recovery is only just starting. Recent good news in Spain, France and Italy was offset by disappointing news elsewhere. With unemployment still very high we are not likely to see inflation become a problem in Europe for some time. Therefore the ECB are most likely to keep printing money as they have stated, until September 2016 at the earliest. Central Banks are also in no hurry to raise interest rates. This should, going forward, keep the lid on sovereign bond yields and support bond prices. Either way, government bonds remain an unattractive investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major question for bond holders is what will happen once central banks do begin to raise interest rates? The government bonds from countries such as the US, the UK, Germany and Japan all have high credit ratings and therefore yields are determined by the outlook for interest rates. Short duration bonds (less than 10 years) are influenced by current interest rates, while long term bonds are affected by how investors expect rates to change in the years ahead. This is equally true of corporate bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rout in government bond values in May intensified fears amongst analysts over the lack of liquidity in bond markets. A big sell-off in gilts, corporate bonds and high-yield bonds perhaps triggered by the start of potential US interest rate rises in October 2015; ECB tapering QE after September 2016; or the emerging markets struggling with rising US$ values, would create major liquidity problems as sellers crowd the exits. Bonds by their nature tend to be attractive to cautious and often retired investors, those least wanting to tolerate losses.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

	('node','article',0,123,123,'und',0,'<p>Mario Draghi, the ECB President, must be very pleased with the early results of his QE programme. He has confirmed, irrespective of the initial impact, the ECB bond buying programme will be implemented in full. This will mean a &euro;1.1tn capital injection into the Eurozone economy through to September 2016. Mr Draghi believes it will take time for the full benefits to spread to the wider economy and return inflation to its target of 2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics of QE have warned that the ECB&lsquo;s monetary policy lets national politicians off the hook on essential reform and that ultimately political inaction will raise pressure to maintain emergency low levels of interest for longer. While Mr Draghi accepts these points, he currently considers them the price to pay to help countries with huge debt burdens reduce their borrowing costs and start a recovery. He considers the implementation of the full QE programme as vital to boosting confidence, growing investment, and creating higher consumption and stable inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German investors were buying up gold bars and coins as a hedge against the QE programme in Europe and the threat of a Greek default. Gold is seen as a safe haven to protect against inflation and economic crisis. While overall gold demand fell across the world, it significantly increased in Germany. Generally with the absence of strong inflationary pressure and a raising US$, gold is unlikely to record any significant price movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial market reaction to the developments in Greece has been relatively muted up until early June when markets started to become very nervous. With the absence of an agreement, the risk of bond rate rising as an upward adjustment of the risk premium and losses on equity markets could materialise. While it is generally believed that the European Banks can withstand a Greek default, it would be unwise to consider that the default could be contained without global loses and some peripheral contagion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECB&rsquo;s bigger concern in some respect is what happens to the world economy when the US Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates.

As a result much of the early Q1 2015 equity gains have been given up, if only temporally. Investors in markets such as Europe, Japan, China and India will have overall enjoyed significantly higher rewards than other economies; however, prospects going forward may be less attractive.

As far as fixed interest securities are concerned, we are cautious of the potential rise in US interest rates and while not imminent, the return of inflation. We have maintained our holdings in UK corporate bonds and high yield bonds as they represent reasonable value. However we have reduced our overall fixed interest holdings and transferred a proportion of the portfolios to UK property funds that are offering both better yields and growth prospects.

	('node','article',0,127,127,'und',0,'<p>On 8 July, George Osborne delivered the first Conservative Government Budget for 19 years. Many headlines had already been flagged-up in advance so there were no immediate surprises. As usual &lsquo;the devil is in the detail&rsquo; however, in this article we look behind the headlines and provide further detail about those Budget measures of particular interest to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further consultation will be issued, and the draft second finance bill of 2015 is expected on the 15 July 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Income tax</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personal allowance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax-free personal allowance is being increased to &pound;11,000 in 2016-17, and &pound;11,200 in 2017-18.<br />\r\nFor higher rate taxpayers, the government will also increase the threshold above which higher earners start paying 40% tax. It will increase to &pound;43,000 in 2016-17, and to &pound;43,600 in 2017-18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dividend Taxation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2016 Dividend Tax Credit will be abolished. To replace this, a new Dividend Tax Allowance of &pound;5,000 per tax year will be introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new rates of tax on dividend income will be 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate tax payers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Individual Savings Accounts</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the March 2015 Budget the Government announced a change in the ISA rules, to allow individuals to withdraw and replace money from their cash ISA in a year without it counting towards their annual ISA subscription limit. The Government have announced that this will also apply to cash held in stocks and shares ISAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both changes take effect from 6 April 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Corporation tax</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 20% to 19% in 2017. It will reduce to 18% on 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Inheritance tax</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inheritance tax &ndash; Main residence nil-rate band and existing nil-rate band</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An additional nil-rate band will apply when a residence is passed on death to a direct descendant (children (step-children, adopted child or foster child or grandchildren). This will be &pound;100,000 in 2017-18; &pound;125,000 in 2018-19, &pound;150,000 in 2019-20, and &pound;175,000 in 2020-21. This will then increase in line with Consumer Prices Index (CPI) from 2021-22 onwards. Any unused additional nil-rate band will be transferrable to a surviving spouse or civil partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The additional nil-rate band will also be available when a person downsizes or ceases to own a home on or after 8 July 2015 and assets of an equivalent value, up to the value of the additional nil-rate band, are passed on death to direct descendants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a tapered withdrawal of the additional nil-rate band for estates, including the main residence, with a value of more than &pound;2million (after deduction of any liabilities, but before reliefs and exemptions). This will be at a withdrawal rate of &pound;1 for every &pound;2 over this threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This measure will take effect for relevant transfers on death on or after 6 April 2017. It will apply to reduce the tax payable by an estate on death (similar to the transferable nil-rate band) and it will not apply to reduce the tax payable on lifetime transfers that become chargeable as a result of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main residence nil-rate band will be transferable where a surviving spouse or civil partner in a couple dies on or after 6 April 2017, irrespective of when the first of them died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The qualifying residence will be limited to one residential property but personal representatives will be able to nominate which residential property should qualify if there is more than one in the estate. A property which was never a residence of the deceased, such as a buy-to-let, will not qualify.<br />\r\n<strong>The detail is subject to consultation, which will be published in September 2015 ahead of the draft Finance Bill 2016.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nil-rate Band frozen until the end of 2020-21</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The existing nil-rate band will remain at &pound;325,000 until the end of 2020-21. It was previously frozen until the end of 2018-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Simplifying charges on trusts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislation will be introduced to remove the requirement to include non-relevant property in the calculation of 10-year periodic charges and exit charges. In addition, new rules will ensure that where property is added to two or more relevant property settlements on the same day after commencement of the settlements, the values added along with the values added at commencement will be bought into account when calculating the rate of tax for the purposes of 10- year periodic charges and exit charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other legislation covering trust property settled by a Will, allows for an appointment to be made in favour of the surviving spouse or civil partner being entitled to the spousal IHT exemption. The exemption will be available as long as the appointment is done within three months of the death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Pensions</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Immediate change to the annual allowance for 2015/16</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2016/17 pension input periods will be aligned with tax years. In order to make this happen, the Government are making changes to the annual allowance for 2015/16 with effect from 8 July 2015. The Government have issued guidance, and you may be glad to hear that the rules that apply to pension savings for 2015/16 are at least as complicated as the special annual allowance introduced in 2009. In effect it means that individuals will be able to benefit from an additional year&rsquo;s worth of annual allowance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone will have a total annual allowance of &pound;80,000 for 2015/16, plus available carry forward for the three previous tax years. All pension input periods that are open on the 8th July 2015 will end on that date with the next period running from the 9th July 2015 to the 6th April 2016. Pension savings for pension input periods ending in 2015/16 will be split into two &lsquo;mini&rsquo; tax years, depending on whether they ended before the 9th July 2015 or in a post-budget pension input period which will run from 9th July 2015 and end on 5th April 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all pension input periods ending on or after 6 April 2015 and on or before 8th July 2015, individuals will have an annual allowance of &pound;80,000, plus available carry forward. Pension savings from 9th July 2015 to the 5th April 2016 will have a nil annual allowance, but up to &pound;40,000 of any unused annual allowance for the period up to 8th July 2015 is added to this, in addition to any remaining carry forward from the previous three tax years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Annual allowance changes for April 2016/17</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government is pushing ahead with its manifesto pledge to reduce the tax relief for people earning more than &pound;150,000. Their annual allowance will reduce by 50p for every &pound;1 of income in a range between &pound;150,000 and &pound;210,000, so that someone with an income of &pound;210,000 or more will have an annual allowance of &pound;10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government consults on the future of pension tax relief</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pension tax relief rules are complex. Complexity acts as a disincentive if people cannot understand the benefit of saving for their later life. The 12-week consultation does not put forward a specific proposal for reform, instead it is seeking suggestions about whether and how the current system of pension tax relief should be reformed. It is not proposing incentives for pension savings are scrapped altogether, quite the opposite, instead it wants to ensure that the incentives to save for retirement are &ldquo;clear, simple and transparent&rdquo;, ensuring that individuals make sufficient savings for later life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any change will not occur overnight, and the government is clear that it will proceed gradually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxation of lump sum death benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2015, pension savings can be paid out tax-free if a member died before age 75 and the lump sum was paid within two years of the member&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a 45% tax charge applies if the lump sum is paid after two years, or in respect of a member who died after age 75. From April 2016 the tax payable on lump sums paid after two years or post age 75 will be based on the marginal rate of the recipient, with the exception of lump sums paid to non-individuals like Trusts or Companies, for which the rate will remain at 45%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barriers to accessing &lsquo;pension freedoms&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government will consult imminently on options to improve the pension transfer process, aiming to make it quicker and smoother. They confirm that if there is evidence of exit penalties hindering the process, they will act by legislating a cap on early exit penalties for those aged 55 or over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pension Wise access for age 50 upwards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government is extending access to Pension Wise, the free and impartial guidance service, to those aged 50 and above. Having received criticism that Pension Wise is not widely known, a nationwide marketing campaign will be launched to raise awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Secondary annuity market delayed until 2017</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government confirmed the secondary annuity market enabling consumers to sell their annuities for a lump sum will be delayed until 2017. This is to ensure sufficient time to create a market and support service to ensure consumers are making the right decision. Plans for the secondary annuity market will be set out in the Autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Changes to domicile rules</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Permanent non-domicile status to be abolished</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chancellor has today announced changes to the deemed domicile rules, which are due to apply from April 2017. A detailed consultation document will be published after the summer recess on the best way to deliver these reforms. Further consultation will follow on the draft legislation which is intended to form part of the 2016 Finance Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deemed domicile</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 6 April 2017, irrespective of when someone arrived in the UK, those who have been resident in the UK for 15 out of the past 20 (the 15 year rule) tax years will be treated as deemed UK domiciled for all tax purposes. This means that they will no longer be able to use the remittance basis of taxation and will be deemed domicile for IHT purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore someone who has already been in the UK for 15 years, and remains in the UK from the 6 April 2017, will be caught by the new regime and be unable to access the remittance basis. The government will consult on whether split years of UK residence will count towards the &lsquo;15 year rule&rsquo;.<br />\r\nOnce a non-domicile has become deemed domicile under the &rsquo;15 year rule&rsquo; and spends more than 5 years outside the UK, at that point they will lose their deemed domicile status (the &lsquo;five year rule&rsquo;). This is likely only to be relevant for IHT purposes; however there is an increase in the &lsquo;inheritance tax tail&rsquo; from the 6 April 2017, as currently this would only be relevant for four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who had a domicile in the UK at the date of their birth will revert to having a UK domicile for tax purposes whenever they are resident in the UK, even if under general law they acquired a domicile in another country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Domicile of choice changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to align the treatment of UK domiciles and non-domiciles, UK domiciles who leave after 5 April 2017, having been in the UK for more than 15 years, will also be subject to the &lsquo;five year rule&rsquo; even if they intend to emigrate permanently and settle in a particular place on the day of departure. The government will consult on the interactions between the new five year rule and existing three and four year rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Excluded property trusts and non-domiciles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technical note issued as part of the Summer Budget documents &lsquo;technical briefing on Non Dom changes announced at Summer Budget 2015&rsquo; confirmed that the use of excluded property trusts will have the same IHT treatment as at present (except for the 15 out of 20 rule), other than the announcement made in relation to UK residential property, (see below). However, such long-term residents will, from April 2017, be taxed on any benefits, capital or income received from any trusts on a worldwide basis. The government recognises that this is a significant change to the current rules and that changes to trust taxation are complex and will therefore consult on the necessary details. We await the detail of these proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non dom/UK dom consultation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government intends to consult further on the interaction of the various deemed domicile rules for both UK domiciles and non-domiciles and also in relation to the tax treatment of trusts. No date has been indicated for when these consultations will be issued. However, it is proposed that the measures are to be introduced from 6 April 2017and legislated in the Finance Bill 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non dom/IHT residential property changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2017, non-UK domiciled individuals will be liable to UK IHT on UK residential property which is held in an offshore company/partnership or offshore trust. This applies to all UK residential property, whether it is occupied or let and whatever its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This change applies to UK residential property only. The change will not apply to any other UK assets and neither does it change the rules regarding non-UK assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Tax avoidance and tax evasion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tackling offshore evasion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is relevant for financial institutions, tax advisers and other professionals that may be aware of, or may have given advice in respect of, an offshore account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government will legislate in the Summer Finance Bill 2015 to amend Section 222 of the Finance Act 2013.

	('node','article',0,128,128,'und',0,'<p>In recent weeks all the financial news has been focused upon a solution for the Greek debt crisis. The referendum in Greece followed by the financial and political negotiations in Brussels, has keep this current Greek tragedy on the front pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However a bigger drama has been playing out while being virtually unreported in the UK until this week and that is the spectacular growth and then fall in Chinese stock markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial and investment implications of the events in Shanghai are far more important to the world economy than those of Greece. To put the economies in context, China has 20 cities that are bigger than the whole of Greece and an economy 40 times larger. The fall in Chinese share prices in June were 13 times the size of the Greek economy. The knock on impact of the Chinese stock market losing a third of its value is far more significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebalancing of the Chinese economy from investment and export driven towards domestic consumption is a key pillar of the Beijing reform programme. Part of this programme was the ongoing promotion by the Chinese authorities of property and equity markets in order to create growth and a feel good factor within China. The outcome has been millions of inexperienced private investors pushing up Chinese stocks creating a bubble that has spectacularly burst. The Chinese government were encouraging equity investment right up to the point the market corrected. This has made policy makers look inept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2014, the Shanghai Composite Index stood at 2177 and by early June 2015 had grown 237% to 5166. Seven weeks later it stood at 3725 a fall of 28% including an 8.5% decline suffered on 27th July. This was the sharpest one day fall for eight years despite the Chinese government trying to support the market. This fall sent tremors around the global commodity markets and hit currency values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with these recent falls the Shanghai Composite index is up 170% over one year and up 9.6% since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is however concern that the Communist Party is losing control of their economy having stoked up a series of asset bubbles, first in residential property and then equities in order to keep up the pace of economic growth. The Chinese stabilisation measures adopted since the first big sell off in June did not work. Commentators think that the Chinese authorities have put a lot of credibility on the line to shore up prices and this credibility has been damaged. The government has already bought $250 bn Chinese equities and has a credit line of $450 bn if necessary. They have also adopted measures to close the market, ban short selling and forced brokerage houses to buy stock. Unfortunately this is leading to a false market, building up unnecessary stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly markets need to settle at levels that can be sustained on fundamental reasons which may well mean the Chinese State swallowing some heavy losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the rest of the world the events in China have much bearing. China consumes 50% of global coal, 43% of industrial metals and 23% of world grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dangers posed specifically by the Chinese stock market falls may well have been over stated. The main concern is the slowing of the real economy and the impact that a lack of Chinese spending is having on the rest of the world particularly the BRIC economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it happens the Chinese stock market is not that significant in relation to China&rsquo;s real economy as for decades the stock market has not mirrored the nations GDP growth. Only 1 in 30 chinese people own shares as compared to 1 in 7 in the USA. For all the 100 million stock broking accounts in Shanghai most are owned by the wealthy and who are unlikely to scale back spending due to stock market falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an inevitable slowing in the rate of growth as a result of China&rsquo;s new higher level of development. The fall off from 14.2% pa GDP growth in 2007 to about 6.8% this year is in line with the experience of other Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However unlike most western countries, the Chinese authorities have plenty of options to support their economy. They have already cut interest rates four times so far this year but still have room to cut further if need be. Their current bank lending rate is 4.85% far higher than that of the West. The nation&rsquo;s banks are still in public ownership and so if the economy were to weaken the authorities could instruct the banks to keep lending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If China is to become a normal economy and realise its full economic potential then the share of the economy based upon private consumption needs to rise from the current 38%. In order for this to happen the share taken up by investment and exports will need to fall. This is a great challenge to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As and when China becomes a consumer society it will have a huge impact on the world. If we just consider tourism a growing industry for Chinese travellers. Currently travel out of China by the Chinese exceeds arrivals into China by 4 to 1 even though only 1 in 20 Chinese have a passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since last autumn when Chinese stock markets were beginning their bull run, there have been warnings of a bubble. Having now corrected, fair value has been restored after the momentum speculation of millions of private investors. We feel that this new fair value could continue to grow for many years but not without some bumps along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As stated before we remain cautious but invested in China as the consumer growth story despite its volatility remains the core investment case.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

Barclays Bank is now predicting a March 2016 rate rise, while some hedge fund managers are calling for the Fed to restart Quantitative easing (QE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The US economy grew by more than expected in Q2 at 3.7% GDP growth, up from 2.3% due to strong consumer and government spending as well as higher export revenue. While the likelihood of a rate rise in September has reduced, these figures will support the Fed in taking action to increase borrowing costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">There is often volatility in markets when a market braces itself for change. It is therefore not surprising this has been happening as we get closer to expected date of a Fed funds rate rise. The US economy has a debt imbalance that the Fed wishes to correct and an economy with enough fundamental strength from jobs growth and a housing recovery to allow for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The dilemma facing Janet Yellan and Mark Carney is that they both wish to end the era of near zero interest rates by slowly and gradually increasing rates. To do this now at a time of deflationary anxiety over the health of the global economy may well turn a significant correction into something worse. We are not expecting the US, as some have called for, to return to QE in order to stimulate growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">This year the US$ has risen in value by 20% over a basket of major currencies. The dollar rise has undermined commodities that are priced in US$. This has put a squeeze on growth in emerging markets some of which are being hit by the rising cost of dollar denominated debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The value of the US$ is likely to rise further as and when the US moves towards tightening monetary policy with a rise in interest rates.

	('node','article',0,133,133,'und',0,'<p class=\"rtejustify\">From September 2014 through to June 2015, we witnessed a remarkable stock market boom in China. This Bull Run was supported by the further opening of the Chinese stock market to international investment and by the Chinese authority&rsquo;s encouragement of domestic investment. The Shanghai Composite Index started September priced at 2200 points rising to 5166 in mid-June prior to the first market correction. Over the past 8 weeks the index has fallen back to 3232, the level at which it started 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">On 11th August, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) released the Yuan from its US$ peg and devalued the currency by around 2%. The PBoC&rsquo;s action followed a report confirming an 8% drop in Chinese exports and was directly aimed at increasing export demand and improving job creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The implication of this devaluation was that China&rsquo;s economy needed the assistance of a lower exchange rate which caused shock waves in world markets. It was the day that the world realized that deflation was a global threat. Many commentators were taken aback by this move as the devaluation came at the same time as falling stock markets and a major sell off in commodity prices. The exchange rate reduction immediately created fears of a currency and export war which could see competing countries racing to weaken their currencies, driving prices lower and hitting company profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The Shanghai Composite Index suffered its worse one day fall since 2007 loosing 8.5% on &ldquo;Black Monday&rdquo; 24th August and then fell a further 7.6% the next day. Both of these falls came immediately after a week when the Index had already lost 11.5% of its value. The shock of these loses spread across the world, hitting all markets and whipped out all the gains the Shanghai Index has made during 2015. The Dow Jones Index fell 1000 points and the FTSE 100 lost 4.7% of its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">These dramatic declines represented uncertainty, fear of deflation and panic selling. The fact this happened in August, a holiday month, where trade levels are low only made the percentages bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">Western markets have bounced back with stocks recovering most of the week&rsquo;s earlier losses. By Friday 28th the FTSE 100 was back to 6247 having dropped to 5898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The Chinese Authorities must take their share of the blame. They actively stoked up stock market mania in Shanghai, expecting a growing equity market could reflate the Chinese economy. Since the start of the collapse, Beijing has taken action to stabilise the market. They have tightening rules on short selling, banning large shareholders from off-loading stock and forcing national pension funds to buy domestic stock. Despite these high handed anti open market tactics or even because of them the Shanghai Index fell still further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The falls came to an end when the PBoC stepped in with an interest rate cut of 0.25% reducing borrowing costs to 4.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The events of the last two weeks have been some of the most dramatic of the last seven years with stock market losses around the world flying in the face of a slow but evident global recovery. What is more, the vast majority of economists, investment professionals and commentators did not see this coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">It is clear that overvalued stock prices were suddenly hit by the reality of slowing economic growth and the threat of deflation.&nbsp; Fear of deflation was the result of slowing growth, falling commodity prices and the devaluation in the Yuan. These events cause deflationary pressure which is the last thing a fragile global recovery needs. If Beijing was to further support its export and domestic job market with further devaluation, then the fear of deflation will intensify hitting markets further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The devaluing of a currency exchange at the same time as cutting interest rates as the Chinese authorities have done four times this year does have dangerous consequences particularly in inviting outflows of capital. US$800bn has already left China this year with US$200bn fleeing in July. The PBoC holds US$3.7tr in foreign currency reserves, by far the world&rsquo;s largest, and is burning through these reserves in order to defend its currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">There has been real fear expressed that Beijing has in some way lost control of its plan to manage its objectives of solid growth while also deflating its credit bubble. The recent performance of the stock market should not however be mistaken for the performance of China&rsquo;s real economy. Only 3% of China&rsquo;s population own shares so market losses will not directly affect many. Beijing has certainly made mistakes over trying to control stock market speculation but it does still have a sound grip on the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">There is no doubt that China is slowing, official figures has put GDP growth at 6.8%, however many economists consider actual growth at about 4-5% pa and even this lower growth rate does not justify panic. If China manages a smooth transition to a slower more sustainable economy it is still likely to be fast enough to raise Chinese living standards and domestic consumption. To achieve this many economists are calling for a major blast of fiscal spending. In response, the Chinese government plans to pull forward a raft of spending plans scheduled for 2016 which come on top of a 13% increase in government spending for Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">China industrial sector has slowed this year but there is not a sign of a slump. Industrial output has increased by 6% and retail sales up an encouraging 10.5% this year. Looser monetary policy takes longer to take effect in China than it does in Western economies so this year&rsquo;s interest rate reductions are starting to come through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">China&rsquo;s service sector which is now bigger than its manufacturing sector is looking healthy. The property sector is improving. House prices have risen for the past three months and sales are up 18.9% year on year to July. This is particularly important as the housing market and its related industries comprise 25% of Chinese GDP. House sales values in the largest 44 cities are up 34% in the first half of 2015 compared to 2014. Land acquisition is up a massive 92% on 2014 and construction start-ups up 5.2%. The lowering of interest rates this year has aided this growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The general consensus is that the situation in China is manageable particularly if Beijing accepts the cost and pain of stock market losses and moves swiftly to deal with any bad debt that could spiral in China due to capital outflows and a slowing economy. Fortunately China has a great deal of slack in the system to fall back on. It has far more scope to act than Western economies through major spending projects, foreign currency reserves and interest rate cuts. The economy can still benefit from liberalising reform and the events of this summer may be the shock that improves the pace of that reform.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

	('node','article',0,147,147,'und',0,'<p>Our decision will have far reaching economic impact spanning future generations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An in/out referendum on the UK membership of the EU will take place by the end of 2017 but possibly as early as the summer of 2016. This referendum will be very important and may not be that far away. Our decision will have far reaching economic impact affecting ourselves and future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key foundation of the EU is the single market, one which promotes the freedom of movement of goods, services, people, and capital. The underlying belief is that a single market helps to underpin prosperity, by fostering competition and ensuring efficient allocation of resources. The single market is assisted by the use of a single currency in 19 of the 28 member states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these founding principles the process of creating a single market in all sectors of the economy is by no means complete. The Euro has been under stain for several years and recently the free movement of labour has also come under pressure. Passport and border controls have been abolished in the Schengen Area, which comprises of 22 of the EU member countries along with Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. However Germany has recently brought back border controls with Austria after large numbers of migrants from war torn Syrian travelled from Hungary via Austria into south Germany. The UK along with Ireland negotiated to opt out of the Schengen Area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK Currently accounts for 12.5% of the EU population and 15% of its GDP. We import 9.3% of EU imports and export 6.3% of all EU exports.&nbsp; We are the fourth largest net contributor to the EU budget after Germany, France and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last financial year 2014/15 the UK&rsquo;s net payment after rebates and EU receipts was &pound;9bn about 0.46% of UK GDP. It is expected to stay at &pound;9bn for the next few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some exponents of a UK exit from the EU claimed in September 2013 that the true cost of EU membership is somewhat different. The full indirect costs were assessed and they overshadow the direct costs substantially. If added to the direct costs, the cost of lost jobs due to immigration, waste, regulation, resource misallocation, fraud and corruption that would mean that the figure rises to a massive 11% of GDP. These figures are, as one might expect, disputed by the pro EU campaign. It should be remembered that these costs do bring benefits to the UK and balancing the two is the assessment that needs to be made in order to come to a reasoned judgement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The share of UK trade with the EU has been declining in recent years but it is still our largest trade partner. Just over 45% of UK exports went to the EU while 50% of imports came the other way in 2014/15. The UK has a growing trade deficit with EU countries but a growing trade surplus with non EU countries. An argument is often made that the UK is hampered in taking advantage of trade outside the EU by virtue of the fact that the EU negotiate on behalf of all members, the trade and tariff terms with the rest of the World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strength of the UK trade with non EU countries may counter that argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 10 years prior to the UK joining the EU in 1973, the UK GDP per capita was weaker than the average of the EU. It has been consistently stronger than the rest since membership in 1973 according to Thomson Reuters. It therefore seems hard to argue that membership has effected growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Conservative government&rsquo;s objective appears to be to secure enough changes in EU law, regulation and practise that would enable the Prime Minister to go to the country with the proposal that the changes negotiated would change the character of the EU sufficiently to justify continued British membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes sought are in four main areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a curb on the rights of immigrant workers to receive UK welfare payments. A four year waiting period before in work benefits are available and the removal of jobseekers benefits if not in work are the conditions sought. Germany and Spain are both seeking similar tightening up of immigrant benefit entitlement. Progress on this issue seems possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, The UK wants to be excluded from the EU objective of &ldquo;ever closer union&rdquo;. Other EU members outside the Eurozone are sympathetic to this objective. By contrast the members of the Eurozone do need ever closer union if the Eurozone is to avoid the kind of crisis that has bedevilled the currency over the past five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, The UK is seeking general improvement in the overall competitiveness of the EU including greater cost cutting and accountability. Germany is particularly sympathetic to this cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourthly, Ministers are concerned that the 19 Eurozone countries will use majority voting in the 28 member EU to change rules to the detriment of non-euro nations. This is especially relevant to financial regulation and the City of London. The UK is seeking binding principles to ensure this does not happen. Unfortunately for Mr Cameron any new rules have to be part of treaties and will not be completed before the UK goes to the polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a range of Brexit scenarios, all with different implications to the UK economy. In September 2015 four economic studies from independent research institutions made predictions that leaving the EU would have a negative impact on UK GDP growth. Each of the studies used different time periods but all had a similar conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial markets, are for the time being, ignoring the risk of a Brexit as so much is still yet to be negotiated. Apart from by the end of 2017 there is little indication as to when the referendum will take place and which post Brexit option the government would take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan Stanley has recently published a 75 page report modelling the impact of the referendum on the UK economy. They have called a 35% probability of a leave vote and a 50% probability of a very close vote. They also predict that UK growth would fall to 1% in 2017/18 and inflation would rise to over the BoE target of 2% with the Government having to cut interest rates to revive the recovery.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

The generosity of final salary pensions, better state pensions and the prudence of the baby boomer generation for saving and paying off debt have made the retired better off than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On average, UK pensioners earn &pound;394 pw compared to &pound;385 pw of the working age population. Only 25 years ago, pensioners were 30% behind the average income of workers. Such is the recent advance that 4 out of 10 pensioners earn more in retirement than they did on average through their working life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these &ldquo;baby boomers&rdquo; benefits are encouraging The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that future pensioner wealth could fall within a decade due to financial pressures on the younger generation. These issues include the decline of final salary pensions, the savings gap and the ability to get on the housing ladder. With people now living longer, the overall generosity of the state pension is likely to be paired back as it becomes more expensive to provide. It is predicted that people in their 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s may well end up with lower relative income in retirement than their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Men are now starting to outlive women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The better off males in Britain are now for the first time outliving the average life expectancy of a woman. Over the past 30 years, men have been closing the life expectancy gap with a seven year increase in average male life expectancy. Women have enjoyed a corresponding 4.5 year increase. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that better off males could now expect to live to 82.5 years old which is marginal higher than the average woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longevity figures have been influenced by women working full time and bringing up children. Men have seen the decline in heavy industry, improved lifestyles and falling smoker rates, all have enhanced life expectancy.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,149,149,'und',0,'<p>The great recession of 2008 has led to record peacetime government budget deficits across the developed world. These massive debt piles have highlighted to governments the cost of generous pension and welfare benefit arrangements enacted decades earlier. The impact of the great recession was to erase &pound; trillions in private wealth around the world leaving many with insufficient assets to fully realise the comfortable retirement that they had once expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against a backdrop of people living longer and the current retired generation benefiting more than any before, there is a sense that the relative standards of living will fall for the next and subsequent generations. There are some key factors that will influence whether these senses become a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of these factors is the unprecedented rise in the number of people across the developed world that will enter retirement and the impact that this will have on government spending on health and pensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second factor is who will produce the goods and services in sufficient quantity that these retirees will consume and who will purchase the assets that they may wish to sell to finance their retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been shown that if the developed world wishes to maintain their current retirement ages then they will not be able to rely on their own working population alone to produce the goods they require.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An offsetting force is the strong growth in the more advanced emerging economies of India,China and other Asian countries. They will soon provide the bulk of the world output. The challenge over economic growth and demographics is whether the emerging economies will be productive enough to produce the goods and services to generate sufficient savings to purchase assets from the developed world&rsquo;s new retirees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1946 and 1964 birth rates significantly rose above the average of the previous two decades. The so called &quot;baby boomers&quot; were then followed by a baby bust. In Europe for example average birth rates fell from 2.5 in 1960 to 1.8 in 2010. In the Mediterranean countries it fell below 1.5. In Asia the birth rate per family is even lower. In Japan and South Korea it is 1.3 and in China it is of course just 1. China has recently ended its one child policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research at Cambridge University has illustrated that since 1840 life expectancy in the developed world has increase at a constant rate of 2.5 years per decade. The improvement in mortality rates among the baby boomers combined with the reduction in birth rates has dramatically changed the age distribution of the worlds advanced economies. By 2040 the age profile of Japan, Greece, Spain and Portugal will be inverted. The heaviest population bracket will be people in their 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s with the number over 80 outnumbering children aged under 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the western world there has been a trend of reducing retirement ages. The combined forces of rising life expectancy and falling retirement age will result in a dramatic rise in the number of years the average worker is retired. An increase in retired life is particularly significant as millions of people across the developed world expect to enjoy general good health supported by income benefits provided by the state, corporations or privately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This golden age of increased life expectancy and early retirement cannot continue. As we know in the UK basic state pension ages have already been raised to age 65 for both sexes and then moving both to 66 and then 68.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics from 2013 show that the USA has 28 retires per 100 workers. This is expected to rise to 56 per 100 by 2060. In japan it is 49 per 100 but rising to 113 per 100 by 2060. Across Europe the 2060 figure is predicted to be 76 per 100 workers. These predictions assume a 65 retirement age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the exception of China the rise in the number of retirees in the emerging economies is much more gradual. Between 2015 and 2033, when the vast majority of baby boomers in developed economies will have retired, the number of retirees per 100 workers will have risen from 11 today to only 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This age wave of baby boomers in retirement may have a negative impact on asset values in the future. An increase of retirees could generate an increase in sellers over buyers, a situation that could only depress asset prices. The impact being that future retirees will have to work longer and save more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently about 80% of the world&rsquo;s population live in developing countries. These economies currently produce about 50% of the world&rsquo;s output but this is changing. Since the 1980&rsquo;s the per capital production of the Chinese economy, as measures as a % against US per capita production has risen from a starting point of 2.1%. China has four times the population of US and will become the world&rsquo;s largest economy when the per capital income reaches 25%. This is forecast to happen in 2016. The economy of China is expected to be twice the size of that of the USA by 2025 if both countries per capita income continues as they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth in China&rsquo;s GDP is projected to produce 32% of world output by 2032 but then falling back to 14% by the end of the century. This decline is put down to the one child policy and the long term implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A decade after China started to grow, so started India&rsquo;s economic liberalisation. It is expected that India&rsquo;s GDP growth will surpass China&rsquo;s this year. India&rsquo;s GDP is predicted to exceed the US in the mid 2030&rsquo;s and eventually exceed China. India journey is quite remarkable. It accounted for 3% of world GDP back in 1980 but now produces 6% of global output. It is forecast to grow to 11% by 2032. By 2060 India&rsquo;s economy is expected to be larger than China because of population growth and age demographics. India is predicted to produce about 25% of world GDP by 2040 and maintain that output through the rest of this century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has estimated that the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; as defined as people earning between US$3,650 and US$ 36,500 per annum in emerging economies will increase by more than 3 billion or 170% between 2015 and 2030. While their spending power will increase by 150% rising to over US$34 tn. This is twice the size of the US economy and 80% of that growth is expected in Asia. In contrast the OECD expects that total spending in Western Europe and USA will barely increase over the same timescale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth of the emerging economies has profound and beneficial implications for the developed world. Over the decades ahead, many of the goods required by the retirees of the developed world will be produced by workers in emerging markets. The income earned from selling these goods will support workers savings. Asian&rsquo;s are natural high savers with high national savings ratios. The growth of savings by investors in both developed and emerging economies may result in baby boomers asset value holding up in retirement.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

This gives future pensioners more clarity over what income they can expect from the State, making it easier to plan their private saving to top this up to meet their aspirations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Basic State pension to go up by 2.9% from April</strong><br />\r\nExisting State pensioners will see the basic State pension increase by &pound;3.35, to &pound;119.30 a week, from April - an inflation-busting rise of almost 2.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buy to let market</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a double blow for buy to let owners. The first piece of bad news is the introduction of an increased rate of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) payable on the purchase of second properties worth more &pound;40,000 from April 2016. An additional 3% will be payable on top of the standard SDLT residential rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in moves to bring tax reporting in to the digital age, CGT payable on second homes will need to be paid within 30 days of a disposal from April 2019. This could bring forward the payment of tax by almost 22 months for some sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, these measures are in addition to the proposals to restrict mortgage interest relief on buy to lets to just basic rate, which were announced in the Summer Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IHT: Deeds of Variation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deeds of variation can be used to alter how an individual&#39;s wealth is distributed after their death. Following a consultation, the government will not be restricting their use at the current time. This means that families can still benefit from the flexibility that a deed of variation can bring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the government will continue to monitor this area, so the ideal position continues to be to get planning right before death. Regular reviews and professional advice remain essential for your clients in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Individual tax allowances and bands 2016/17</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal allowance / Higher rate thresholds<br />\r\nThese will remain at the levels announced in the Summer Budget:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal Allowance increases to &pound;11,000 (from &pound;10,600);<br />\r\nHigher rate threshold increases to &pound;43,000 (from &pound;42,385).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A basic rate taxpayer will be better off by &pound;80. Higher rate taxpayers will be better off by &pound;203.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New dividend allowance</strong><br />\r\nAlso confirmed is the new tax free dividend allowance of &pound;5,000. Dividends in excess of this allowance (and any unused personal allowance) will be taxed at the following rates, depending on which tax band they fall in:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basic rate:&nbsp; 7.5%;<br />\r\nHigher rate:&nbsp; 32.5%;<br />\r\nAdditional rate: &nbsp;38.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correspondingly, the system of dividend tax credits will be abolished from April 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that from April 2016, a basic rate taxpayer could have tax free income of up to &pound;17,000 a year&nbsp;when added to the personal allowance of &pound;11,000 and the new &#39;personal savings allowance&#39; announced in the Spring Budget of &pound;1,000. Higher rate taxpayers could have up to &pound;16,500 (as the personal savings allowance is restricted to &pound;500 for these individuals).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain individuals may also have savings income falling into the &pound;5,000 savings rate &#39;band&#39;, currently taxed at 0%. This band continues unchanged next year, meaning that some individuals may have tax free income of up to &pound;22,000, depending on the sources of their income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ISA annual subscription limits</strong><br />\r\nThese will remain unchanged from this year at &pound;15,240 for an ISA, and &pound;4,080 for a Junior ISA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The limits normally increase in line with CPI, measured each year in September. In September 2015, inflation was flat, which is why there will be no increase in the limits for 2016/17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confirmation of allowances and tax bands means that taxpayers can plan ahead with some certainty. Savings can be accumulated and spending needs in retirement met in a tax efficient way, securing the greatest inheritance for their loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be done by:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limiting the effects of tax on future investment returns by making full use of tax privileged investment wrappers.<br />\r\nMinimising the tax payable on withdrawing funds by maximising the use of available allowances.<br />\r\nFuture proofing their retirement strategy to ensure that avoidable future tax charges are not stored up.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a reminder of what is coming in 2016/17 and what you may need to do before April;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LTA cut to &pound;1M</strong><br />\r\nThe pension lifetime allowance is to cut from &pound;1.25M to &pound;1M with new protection options for those expecting to caught.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>AA cut for higher earners</strong><br />\r\nThe standard &pound;40k AA will be reduced by &pound;1 for every &pound;2 of &#39;income&#39; clients have over &pound;110k in a tax year, until their allowance drops to &pound;10k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>&pound;5k Dividend Allowance</strong><br />\r\nA new allowance will see the first &pound;5k of dividends paid tax free.

	('node','article',0,155,155,'und',0,'<p>After the dramatic falls in equity markets in August, stock market volatility extended throughout September. These market falls contributed to the worst quarter in global stock markets since quarter 3 of 2011 and the Eurozone crisis. Confidence in the strength of a global recovery was hit by Chinese data that suggested that their economic activity had fallen. The subsequent official Chinese government intervention in both the foreign exchange and stock markets only exacerbated the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August&rsquo;s devaluation of the Chinese renminbi was a major event and a significant departure by Chinese policy makers. This devaluation was part of a currency war aimed at supporting the competitiveness of Chinese exports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market anxiety almost reached a panic when the Shanghai Composite Index fell by 42% over a horrendous ten week period. Things look quite different now with the index recovering 17% from its August low and up 25% on its value twelve months ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Federal Reserve also contributed to the uncertainty by putting off its decision to raise the federal funds rate in September. Global jitters and some soft data on US job creation meant that dearer money was postponed. This caused investors to ask questions of whether the Fed knew something that they didn&rsquo;t, rather than being pleased that near zero rates had been maintained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding the upturn in volatility in the past six months, the ending of quantitative easing (QE) in the US has been taken relatively well by markets. This reaction is encouraging as the withdrawal of loose money and the December rise in US interest rates further illustrate the growing confidence in the US recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US economy remains flexible and entrepreneurial with better demographics than many of its Asian and European counterparts. The low cost of oil and the development of domestic shale gas will provide low cost energy and a competitive advantage for many years to come. Countries that control their own energy costs, as Britain did during the industrial revolution, have built-in economic advantages.&nbsp;<br />\r\nRecent actions from the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have provided massive monetary easing on an unprecedented scale for these areas. The respective QE programmes are aimed at currency devaluation to create greater export competitiveness. It remains to be seen if central banks in competing countries, adversely affected by these moves, will respond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central banks now have far less ability to respond to adverse economic shocks when their interest rates are at near zero and having already implemented extensive QE programmes. A central bank &ldquo;put&rdquo; where monetary policy can underpin growth, is now less credible and less functional.<br />\r\nSince 2008 we have witnessed hundreds of interest rate cuts and trillions of US$ worth of QE. Still, it feels as though all we have to show for it is a fairly underwhelming stop-start recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the great sell off in August markets have significantly picked up. It is becoming clear that Chinese growth is due to bounce back and markets are positive about the Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December. The postponement of a US interest rate rise in September and the continuation of BoJ and ECB QE have maintained the loose money conditions that have historically lifted stock prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Global growth is holding up better than many commentators&nbsp;had expected&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A global manufacturing recovery has started to emerge in Europe, the US and Japan and is starting to shake off the recession scare of the summer. Chinese data has improved after a deep summer slump in industrial output. Fears in August of the world being dragged into a deflationary cycle, which prompted the heavy market falls, now seem overblown and panic driven as global growth is holding up better than many commentators had expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of global factory output has risen to 51.4 in October fuelled by continuing monetary stimulus. The PMI results improved in the UK, Japan, India, Russia and Vietnam. Chinese PMI for October showed signs of bottoming the cyclical trough. The increase in Chinese PMI was the biggest jump for 15 months and the result of the recent fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts at last feeding through to the real economy. This has also begun to spur on a Chinese housing market revival. The PMI index for the Eurozone rose to 52.3 again lifted by a weaker euro, cheap oil and ECB QE.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','full_html'),

The budget crunch effecting China is now over as the local government bond market has started to work more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s leaders are keeping their country on an economic stimulus. Whether or not this proves to be the correct course of action will be seen in the future, but for now a mini cycle of growth is welcome. China can expect &ldquo;true&rdquo; growth of around 5% this coming year and therefore is not an economy facing collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe, it is hoped that deflation has been held off. The combination of cheap money, cheap oil and a devalued euro are having a positive impact. This position is supported by the ECB continuing its QE programme beyond September 2016. The fiscal squeeze that undermined the Eurozone recovery four years ago is now a memory as Ireland, Spain and Italy are all growing out of austerity measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies in the US have indicated that the austerity policies of the US government from federal through to state and county have reduced national GDP growth by about 1% each year over the past five. US government at all levels is now adding net spending to the US economy having significantly raised their investment programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to much of 2015, the growth outlook for 2016 looks good. Inflation will continue to be low and policy stimulus will be strong due to the combined efforts of Japan, China and Europe&rsquo;s central banks plus the delay to December of a US interest rate rise. The predictions for world GDP growth for 2015 are 3%, rising to 3.4% in 2016&nbsp;<br />\r\nand 3.7% in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risks in the world have not however gone away. We still do not know how the emerging markets will cope with a US$ rate rise hitting their borrowing costs. There are concerns about a general emerging market decline. We also do not really know if the entire world&rsquo;s debt mountain is stable. Central banks may come to realise that they have over stimulated and reflated markets long after it was needed. This is an issue that both Janet Yellen and Mark Carney are currently wrestling with. The US Federal Reserve has started to return to normalised interest rates with a rate rise of 0.25% in December. The Bank of England (BoE) could then follow in November 2016.</p>\r\n','full_html');

The latest Q3 figures for 2015 report a 6.9% year-on-year growth which does nothing to allay these suspicions. The unofficial alternative index covering electricity consumption, bank lending, rail and road cargo, which are all harder to fake than GDP, illustrate a growth of 5% pa. While the world knows that China&nbsp;is slowing, it is the speed at which it is slowing that is important. Industrial and manufacturing production fell 6% year-on-year in Q3 but retail sales grew 10.9%. Chinese consumers are clearly spending which is good news for the service sector which now makes up a much larger proportion of GDP than industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the heavy fall in Chinese equities in August, economists and business leaders were calling for new fiscal spending and a reduction in interest rates. In response the PBC cut rates to 4.35% in October. This was the sixth rate cut this year and signalled to the markets that the government wants to support the economy. The reserve requirement on Chinese banks was reduced by 1% to 17.75% in order to free more capital for lending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shanghai Composite Index has enjoyed a rollercoaster of a ride in 2015.

The US$ hit a currency twelve year high in March and it has remained strong since. Companies within the S&amp;P 500 index currently generate half of their profits abroad. Therefore, the strength of the US$ has squeezed US exports and company earnings. The other issue impacting earnings growth is falling oil prices. The energy sector accounts for 8% of the S&amp;P 500 and within this sector, profits are expected to fall by as much as 65% this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The US$ hit a currency twelve year high in March and it has remained strong since&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The bull run has been assisted by much corporate cost cutting and share buy backs. Generally, it is now felt that American corporations have done all they can to cut costs and boost profit. The US economy is at a stage of the business cycle where companies can no longer maintain earnings growth through these activities. What they really need is sales growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the strongest aspects of the US economy are consumer spending and corporate balance sheets. Both will continue to support economic activity in 2016. Companies are still holding onto record levels of cash and are deploying it in areas such as increased dividends, share buy backs, research and development as well as mergers and acquisitions. The increase in M&amp;A activity is expected to last well into 2016. M&amp;A activity is a classic late cycle activity producing growth through acquisition rather than sales growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fundamentally, dwindling profits and earnings growth do not justify the high price to earnings ratios that are common in large US companies.

The FTSE 250 was not as impacted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK has dipped in and out of deflation this year, firstly in April and then again in September. This fall into negative inflation was put down to lower petrol prices. Core inflation (which does not include volatile food and energy prices) held steady at 1%. Lower prices have put more money into people&rsquo;s pockets particularly when accompanied by wage growth. This increase in household earnings is supporting consumer confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is expecting continued steady growth from the UK. It has predicted that output will grow by 2.5% for 2015 and 2.8% in 2016. Britain is fortunately not just relying on cheap money for this growth. There is plenty of organic momentum. Consumer&rsquo;s real income is rising with wage growth of 2.9%, the fastest rise in six years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has, however, struck a more cautious note and downgraded its forecasts for the UK economy due to uncertain trading conditions. It is predicting now a 2.4% growth in 2015 and 2.6% for 2016. They expect wage inflation to rise to 3.2% next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBI has taken into consideration that the strong &pound; has made exports expensive and more difficult. The UK economy continues to have a strong service sector but weak manufacturing. We are as a nation particularly reliant on financial services and consumption. Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of UK output while energy and utilities account for 5%, construction 6% and the service sector the remaining 79%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low of 5.3% in the three months to September.

With high yield bonds now offering 8% prices have fallen to compensate for these enhanced yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The default rate for non-investment grade high yield bonds is well below the historical average and as yet there has not been an investment grade default.

Some of the trends of 2015 continue with falling commodity prices, particularly oil and concerns over the state of the Chinese economy and the Chinese government&rsquo;s ability to manage its currency adjustment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The falls of 10% in the Chinese stock market last week, caught may investors and analysts by surprise. The months running up to Christmas where showing signs of a strengthening world economy with some improving economic data, 2016 looked like a year able to provide better returns than the highly volatile 2015. For example, the Markit Purchase Managers Index (PMI) across the world was showing an increase in confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However just as we saw last summer, China&rsquo;s volatile stock market has spooked investors around the world. A key question is whether investors have over-reacted to reasons for the falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first week of trading was affected by lower than expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI data for December. The index fell from its pre-Christmas levels indicating a fall in confidence. Another factor effecting stock market sentiment was the end to a ban on selling shares by major Chinese shareholders. This was not an issue about the state of the economy, but shareholders taking profit from the autumn rally when they had the chance to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most concerning event was the Chines central bank allowing the Renminbi to devalue against the US$. The Peoples Bank of China (PBC) reduced its daily rate for the Renminbi by 0.5% which is the largest downward move since last Augusts 2% devaluation. That devaluation resulted in major stock market losses. The PCB later hinted that it could allow the Renminbi/US$ exchange rate to be determined by the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implication of China devaluing its currency in response to other central banks that have devalued their own currencies through rate reductions or quantitative easing (QE) is one of global deflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, the Chinese authorities spent US$ 120bn of their foreign currency reserves. This is massive state intervention to defend the exchange rate. The intervention sought to protect the Renminbi against the ever strengthening US$ and stem capital outflows from China. Chinese foreign currency reserves have fallen from US$ 4tn to US$ 3.33tn. They are using up their reserves at an alarming rate and are getting closer to the US$ 2.6tn deemed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be the prudent level given China&rsquo;s US $1.2tn domestic liabilities and the size of its economy. At current spending rates China has six months before China&rsquo;s once mighty arsenal of capital looks a little inadequate. The authorities are caught between monetary tightening which is the result of selling reserves and maintain the strength of its currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Global markets are acutely sensitive to any signs that China may abandon its defence of the Renminbi, while any currency war would damage global growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese stock market is largely uncorrelated to the real China economy. When the stock market doubled in value last year only then to give up those gains, neither really represented the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Chinese economy. Chinese GDP growth is largely unchanged. We know the economy is inevitable slowing but it is not coming to a haul. The old manufacturing heartlands are in decline but the service sector new economies remain strong. China is about both of these sectors. The transition from export to investment led consumption is progressing but clearly not smoothly. This progress can offer excellent investment opportunities for stock pickers but these opportunities are currently being undermined by a lack of confidence in the overall economy and competence of the Chinese authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets have taken the December rise in US interest rates very well and the rise has in turn strengthen the US$. Any currency devaluation will increase the relative value of US$ and as commodities are priced in US$ will impact on commodity prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a general expectation that the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee will progressively increase US interest rates by small increments throughout 2016, starting perhaps in March or June. However, any slowing of the global recovery may have the effect of delaying such increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aspect of the US economy that is proving resilient is the level of new jobs being created. The US added 292,000 new jobs in December, &nbsp;which was significantly higher than economists had predicted. In 2015, 2.65 million new jobs were created and is evidence of the growing strength of the US recovery. The Fed is expecting new job growth to continue throughout 2016 with Janet Yellen suggesting that the US may create full employment by 2017. These job growth figures are a vindication to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s much debated decision to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has hit its lowest price per barrel at US$32 since April 2002. The falls are due to a lack of global growth resulting in reduced demand and a massive oversupply in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renewed tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia would have in the past put pressure on oil prices. This time there appears to be an expectation that rather than hostilities in the Middle East, the more likely outcome is the intensification of the oil price war further undermining OPEC&#39;s price cartel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia currency, the Riyal, came under pressure last week as the price of oil fell to a US$32pb. Any devaluation of the Riyal could spark a wave of deflation and protectionist policies within the global economy. Saudi Arabia is the world largest producer of crude oil and has a war chest of foreign currency reserves to use to defend its currency.

	('node','article',0,175,175,'und',0,'<p>Over the first three weeks of January, we have witnessed a stock market where fear has fed fear. Markets suffered another panic attack at the beginning of last week, with further falls in oil prices being the trigger. Oil slid to a 12 year low of $28pb after the International Energy Agency said that the world &ldquo;could drown in oversupply&rdquo; now that Iranian crude returns to the market.&nbsp; The ensuing rush to sell on world markets created a dynamic of its own which is hard to gauge and even harder to rationalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many economists have commented upon the herd like mentality effecting investors which pushes down asset prices and which itself becomes counterproductive and self-fulfilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outlook is unusually uncertain but if we do step back there is no real change in the already known growth patterns of the USA and China and that low oil prices are usually good for consumers, manufacturing and transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many UK companies across differing sectors are voicing concern over whether they will hit their earnings forecasts and as a consequence issuing warnings of a downgrade in profits. Business, particularly the energy sector, is being affected by a cocktail of uncertainty over the falling oil prices, slowing Chinese growth and any further rises in US interest rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the recent announcement of Chinese GDP growth &ldquo;officially&rdquo; falling to 6.9% in 2015 from 7.3% in 2014, China still consumed 10.32 million barrels of oil last year. Chinese oil use rose by 2.5% and even&nbsp; with growth likely to fall, Chinese demand for crude oil is set to grow by 1.5% this coming year. Therefore it is not a lack of Chinese demand that is hitting the oil price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual World Economic Forum in Davos gives economists, business leaders and world institutions a chance to discuss the economic expectations for the year ahead. Interestingly even after the stock market volatility in recent weeks, most delegates still expect a continuation of gradual economic expansion and see a low likelihood of a market crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One attendee that did not share this view was George Soros. The billionaire currency trader warned of financial turmoil, a hard landing for debt laden China and the spread of deflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets gained some much needed relief at the end of last week with the belief that central banks will now provide some fresh support. On Tuesday after the Chinese GDP growth figures for 2015 were announced, the Chinese authorities confirmed their awareness of the formidable challenges ahead of them in order to rebalance their economy and their determination to fully address these issues. With large parts of the Chinese economy still state owned as well as the entire banking system, the country has the means to control a gradual slowdown. Much does depend upon how well China manages its slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMF has recently reassessed its growth forecasts and confirmed that its estimate for Chinese GDP growth in 2016 will remain at 6.3%. China was one of the few countries not to be given a growth downgrade for 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday at the European Central Bank (ECB) monthly press conference, President Mario Draghi hinted that the ECB would expand their monetary easing program from March onwards if market action lead to deterioration in the economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECB inflation target is 2% pa and is currently running at 0.2%, way below this target. Back in December Mr Draghi said he expected Eurozone inflation to reach 1% in 2016. He made this prediction assuming oil would be priced at an average of US$50pb and it now stands below US$30pb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Draghi comments last week were interpreted as meaning that the ECB will take further action over Quantitative Easing to stimulate inflation and counter the fall in oil price. His comments calmed the stock market with shares rising across the world. On Friday major stocks markets gained between 2% and 6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reaction to the announcements by the Peoples Bank of China (PBC) and the ECB indicates that the markets are concerned that central banks may be misjudging the continued fragility of economic expansion and have tightened monetary conditions prematurely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World stock markets have been particularly turbulent since the US Federal Reserve increased US interest rates in December and perhaps that is no coincidence after initially responding positively to the rise. European Investment Bank UBS has suggested that the Federal Reserve must also come out and reassure the markets. UBS feels that the Fed needs to cool expectations of how quickly it will move in delivering successive rate rises. This would send a positive message to the market as further rate rises would be damaging. All eyes are therefore on Janet Yellen to see what the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s response will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see there being three key headwinds in 2016, namely the deflationary impact of falling commodity prices, the credit stress in emerging markets following the US interest rate rise and the slowdown in China and the currency control of the Renminbi. Co-ordinated reassurances by the major central banks that they will manage monetary policy with close regard to these challenges is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of last week there was a noticeable change in investor mood. Many technical indicators moved from sell to buy with investors sensing a barging in the &ldquo;January Sales&rdquo; with markets so depressed. We therefore hope we have seen an end of this correction. The change in pulse has made us more confident of a market recovery. If the selloff in early January was psychologically driven rather than reflect the fundamentals of the global economy, prices should rebound as they did last October after Augusts sell off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do however remain cautious, particularly over the implications of a slowing China and the levels of capital leaving the country. This is placing strong downward pressure on the Renminbi. Any resultant devaluation will transfer deflation to the West via lower import prices. America and Europe are therefore under threat of deflationary pressures hitting growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','full_html'),

Gold a safe havens in times of market turbulence reached an eight month high of US$1,239 per ounce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen informed Congress that the recent rout in global stock markets has forced the Fed to delay any further rises in US interest rates, which up until the start of the year were expected as part of a gradual plan to bring US interest rates back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Dr Yellen&rsquo;s comments did little to support markets as traders around the world sold off stock. Last week had an eerie feel of last August about it when fears over China&rsquo;s currency and stock market spilled into the rest of the world&rsquo;s markets. We see traders sell down prices not because of a significant change in the fundamentals but a fear of the unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts are putting the falls down to falling oil prices, slowing growth in China, spikes in the value of the &yen; and weak US economic data. &nbsp;Realistically none of these issues alone should account for the level of losses. The concerns over the stability of European banks may well have been the actual trigger. This was centred on the prospect of negative interest rates and the bearish sentiment of the general state of Europe&rsquo;s banking system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure centred on Germany&rsquo;s largest bank - Deutsche Bank. The banks credit default swaps, which value the cost of insuring the bank against bankruptcy, hit levels not seen since the 2012 Euro crisis. With global growth stalling, it is inevitable that banks will be under scrutiny with markets increasingly worried about central banks&rsquo; ongoing ability to continue to stimulate growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The negative interest rates imposed by several central banks including Japan and Sweden are making it more difficult for retail banks to build capital reserves and make profit from lending. Banks earn much of their profits from lending at higher rates than they borrow at but at zero interest rates there is less scope for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With central banks charging retail banks for &ldquo;parking&rdquo; their cash, banks are loath to pass this cost onto customers. Instead they are charging more for lending which is then tightening credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deutsche Bank saw it shares fall by 15% early last week but then bounced back by 12% on Wednesday after Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany&rsquo;s Finance Minister said he &ldquo;had no concerns about Deutsche&rdquo; and that Deutsche Bank paid back &euro;3bn of euro bonds and $ 2bn of dollar bonds to relieve market worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Deutsche Bank may be making substantial losses it is nowhere close to triggering a write down of its contingent convertible bonds and that in this case investors got a severe case of the jitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Banks are stress tested by the European Central Bank (ECB) but not as rigorously as the Bank of England (BoE) has done in the UK mainly as there are so many more banking institutions to regulate. However, unlike their American counterparts, European banks still hold some bad debt festering on their balance sheets. In the past the ECB has supported the European banks with repeated injections of liquidity to keep even the poorer banks afloat. Now the reality of negative interest rates is making them face a commercial reality and force them to restructure their businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments from Germany&rsquo;s bankers generally do not believe that the wider economy is in trouble yet, but do fear that panic can spread in a self-fulfilling way. They feel that a panic can hurt the short term outlook even if the fundamentals do not really justify such damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A useful counterpoint to the concerns of a down turn was the release of January&rsquo;s forward looking Purchase Managers Index (PMI) figures for many countries and sectors. The PMI is a snapshot of business expectations with readings over 50 indicating a positive outlook. Results for the developed world averaged 52.1 while the emerging world averaged 49.3 with Brazil and Russia in particular bringing down the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed markets seem to be continuing on their path of healing, led by solid performances in the service sector while those emerging markets mainly exposed to commodity exports have experienced a real slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These PMI results are at similar levels to Q4 of 2015 before the recent market falls and indicates that in the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo; not that much has changed and certainly nothing that would justify the selloff we witnessed last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important change is that the markets over the past three weeks appear to have taken seriously the major central banks resolve to keep economic expansion on track. Last week this manifested itself in a fall in the US$ while the Chinese Renminbi gained, leading to an upward movement in commodity and oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the week the majority of markets had enjoyed a relief rally and put back on 2.5% to 3%.

The correlation between the S&amp;P 500 index and Brent Crude price has almost reached 1. This close correlation really does not make sense as the overwhelming majority of global companies benefit from cheaper oil. There are far more oil consumers than producers. Traders are sticking with the view that lower oil prices signal slower demand and slower growth. However it is clear that the current low price is due to massive oversupply that falling demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil revenues of the all-powerful OPEC cartel have fallen from US$1.2tr to US$400bn at a Brent crude price of US$31pb. This amounts to a US$800bn transfer to the manufacturers, transporters and consumers of Europe, Asia and USA. This transfer of capital should be a global stimulus. Interestingly OPEC and non OPEC producers have so far not cut back on their own spending, instead they are dipping into their sovereign wealth funds to put off the pain of austerity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US consumer has not yet started spending this bonus having left it pilling up in bank accounts.

If the outflows are largely to pay off US$ denominated debt then this is both useful and beneficial particularly if the US does reduce dollar liquidity.

The Government has also announced a new Lifetime ISA for those aged between 18 and 40 which will become available from April 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifetime ISA is a new ISA and will sit alongside the Cash, Stocks and Shares and Innovative Finance ISAs. &nbsp;Qualifying investments in a Lifetime ISA will be the same as for a cash or stocks and shares ISA.&nbsp; The rules will in most ways be identical to opening a regular ISA and individuals will be able to open more than one Lifetime ISA during their lives but will only be able to pay into one Lifetime ISA in each tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new ISA will allow savers to contribute up to &pound;4,000 each tax year (within the overall annual subscription) and receive a 25% bonus on those contributions from the government at the end of each tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bonus will be payable by the Government annually to allow for investors to benefit from the tax-free growth on the bonus from the time it is added.&nbsp; The bonus will be limited to &pound;1,000 maximum each year but will only apply until the investor attains age 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors can choose to withdraw their funds to purchase their first home or to retain their investment until age 60 for retirement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifetime ISA will interact with the Help to Buy ISA and during 2017-18 only, additional transfers may be made and matched from the Help to Buy: ISA. &nbsp;Going forward if you have both types of ISA you cannot use the Government bonus from both accounts to put towards your first house purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government is going to explore with the industry whether there should be the flexibility to borrow funds from the Lifetime ISA without incurring a charge if the borrowed funds are fully repaid. In the US for example, some retirement plans allow 50% to be borrowed up to a maximum of $50,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislation for the Lifetime ISA is expected in the autumn following engagement with the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ISA tax advantages during the administration of a deceased&rsquo;s estate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has confirmed that they will legislate to allow the ISA savings of a deceased person to continue to benefit from tax advantages during the administration of their estate.&nbsp; Further plans will follow technical consultation with ISA providers. (Finance Bill 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic deduction of savings income tax:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has announced its intention to change the tax rules so that interest from Open-Ended Investment Companies, authorized unit trusts, investment trust companies and peer-to-peer loans may be paid without deduction of income tax from April 2017. (Finance Bill 2017)</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>CGT rates</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CGT rates will reduce from 18%&nbsp; to 10% (basic rate) and 28% to 20% (higher rate) for chargeable gains, except those made in relation to chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of residential property (that do not qualify for private residence relief), and receipt of carried interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provisions will also make clear that a residential property interest includes an interest in land that has, at any time in the person&rsquo;s ownership, consisted of or included a dwelling, and an interest in land subsisting under a contract for an off-plan purchase. Rules will set out how gains should be calculated in the case of mixed use properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trustee rate of CGT will also be reduced to 20% unless the gain is from residential property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no change to the 10% rate available for gains qualifying for Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CGT &ndash; Lifetime limit on Employee Shareholder Status exemption</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifetime limit of &pound;100,000 on CGT exempt gains that a person can make on the disposal of shares acquired under Employee Shareholder Agreements entered into after 16 March 2016. Gains made in excess of the lifetime limit will be chargeable to CGT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For transfers between spouses or civil partners, the transfer will be treated as being for consideration, therefore the gain will count against the transferor&rsquo;s unused lifetime limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the rate of tax is remaining unchanged, a number of changes in relation to the definition of qualifying gain will be introduced. At a high level these are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>long term investors - external investors in unlisted trading companies will be eligible if held for 3 years+ i.e. no longer need to be employed by the company<br />\r\ntreatment of joint ventures and partnerships - new definitions applying to individuals and trustees who realise gains on shares in a company which invests in a joint venture company<br />\r\ngoodwill on incorporation - to allow&nbsp;Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief to be claimed in respect of gains on the goodwill of a business<br />\r\nassociated disposals - allows Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief to be claimed on an &lsquo;associated disposal&rsquo; of a privately-held asset when the accompanying disposal of business assets is to a family member</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Pensions</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lifetime Allowance to reduce from &pound;1,250,000 to &pound;1,000,000</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A member of a registered pension scheme can currently crystallise up to a value of &pound;1,250,000 (Lifetime Allowance) and not be subject to any additional tax charges. Usually, 25% of the payment can be taken tax-free with the balance taxable as income. This limit for the Lifetime Allowance will reduce to &pound;1,000,000 in 2016/17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifetime Allowance is currently scheduled to begin to rise in line with the consumers prices index (CPI) from 06/04/2018</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fixed Protection 2016 and Individual Protection 2016</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As applied in previous tax years when the Lifetime Allowance was reduced, the government is introducing new forms of protection for those close to the current Lifetime Allowance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be two new forms of protection:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual Protection 2016<br />\r\nFixed Protection 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tapered annual allowance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For anyone who has not triggered the money purchase annual allowance, the standard annual allowance will be &pound;40,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for higher earners, the annual allowance will be reduced if a member&rsquo;s threshold income is above &pound;110,000 and their adjusted income is above &pound;150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual allowance reduction is &pound;1 for every &pound;2 that the adjusted income exceeds &pound;150,000, subject to a maximum reduction of &pound;30,000, i.e. an annual allowance of &pound;10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a client has any unused annual allowance from any of the previous three tax years, this can also be carried forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp; Changes to death benefit taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If a member of a registered pension scheme (RPS) dies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) on, or after, their 75th birthday; and<br />\r\nb) the death benefit is not paid to a UK charity within two years of the date that the scheme administrator became aware of the member&rsquo;s death, any payment to a &lsquo;qualifying person&rsquo; (i.e. an individual in their own capacity) would be taxed at the recipient&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate(s) using the pay as you earn (PAYE) system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pensions tax relief</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No change to the existing pension tax relief system announced, but we don&rsquo;t think further reform is off the table permanently. A new Lifetime ISA has been announced but does not seem to impact the current pension&rsquo;s tax regime. However, it may lead to younger individuals without a mortgage opting out of their automatic enrolment scheme in favour of saving for their first property.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Salary Sacrifice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government confirmed that income tax and National Insurance Contribution relief provided through salary sacrifice will continue for pension savings and other benefits, for example childcare and health-related benefits. However, it may restrict the range of other benefits that can be provided through salary sacrifice arrangements. This is a sensible approach and is good news for working families and pension savers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Serious ill-health lump sum (SIHLS) taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government will alter the tax treatment of a SIHLS to bring it into line with the way that lump sum death benefits are taxed. This means a SIHLS will be tax-free when someone aged under 75 has less than a year to live but has already accessed their pension. A SIHLS will be taxable at the member&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate(s) if the member is aged at least 75.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Corporation Tax</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporation tax will be reduced to 17% in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stamp duty land tax changes &ndash; additional residential properties&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Following consultation, the following changes will apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specified timescale&nbsp;will increase from 18 months to 36 months<br />\r\nThe higher rates will apply equally to all purchasers without an exemption for significant investors.&nbsp;<br />\r\nMarried couples who are living separately in circumstances that are likely to become permanent will not be treated as one unit.<br />\r\nA small share (50% or less) in a single property which has been inherited within 36 months prior to the transaction will not be considered an additional property.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stamp duty land tax changes &ndash; commercial properties&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From 17 March 2016 the rates will apply to the value of property over each tax band. The new rates and tax bands will be 0% for the portion of the transaction up to &pound;150,000; 2% between &pound;150,001 and &pound;250,000 and 5% above &pound;250,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Non Domicile Taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was announced in 2015 that Non-UK domicile taxation will be changing.&nbsp; In summary:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An individual will be deemed UK domicile for tax purposes after they are resident for 15 of the past 20 tax years; and<br />\r\nIndividuals who were born in the UK and have a UK domicile of origin will revert to UK domiciled status for tax purposes whilst they are resident in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No additional announcements were made in this Budget.&nbsp; Legislation for these changes will be introduced in 2017 and include charges&nbsp;to UK Inheritance tax on UK residential property held, from April 2017, in&nbsp; an offshore structure such as a trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tax avoidance and tax evasion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government will issue a number of consultations in the summer of 2017 which propose introducing the principle that the issuance of licenses&nbsp;and access to services be conditional on being registered for tax in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, a new legal requirement will be introduced in 2017 to correct past offshore non-compliance. Tough sanctions will be introduced for those who do not make such correction.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,190,190,'und',0,'<p>After last week&rsquo;s budget there are a few things we have learnt about Chancellors George Osbornes intentions over key tax and financial planning matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that after all the media comment and rumour on the changes to higher rate tax relief on pension contributions that where subsequently dropped that Mr Osborne is not finished on pension reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The significant rise in the annual ISA allowance to &pound;20,000 is interesting. ISA are popular and simple and this rise is a welcome particularly to those high earners who will suffer a reduction in their annual pension allowance from &pound;40,000 down to &pound;10,000 this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However it is the Lifetime ISA (LISA) that is more interesting. If you are a 20% tax payer, the &pound;100 tax you get back for every &pound;400 invested makes the LISA tax free on the way in and on the way out. We think we can expect Mr Osborne to progressively expand the LISA so that it becomes for the under 40&rsquo;s the first choice for savings. The Chancellors desire to avoid paying out higher rate relief on pensions will be aided by the popularity of the new LISA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The under 40&rsquo;s may prefer a LISA to a pension in their early saving years and therefore not start a pension until they are in their 40&rsquo;s. This may have a significant impact on early and important pension savings and workplace pensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those under 40 now thinking about accessing a pension fund at age 55 this may change with the new LISA only being available at age 60 (unless it is used to purchase a home).&nbsp; It is likely that the access age for both will become 60.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,193,193,'und',0,'<p>The first quarter of 2016 will go down in market history as the most pronounced V-shaped recovery ever recorded in the first quarter of a year. Fears over both the slowing global economic growth and that central banks may have run out of policy tools to stem a renewed economic slowdown&nbsp;caused the worst Q1 stock market sell off recorded for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By February 11th developed world stock markets had lost between 10 and 20% in value and where thus hovering in the territory between severe correction (-10%) and full blown bear market (-20%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the mood and momentum turned as oil and commodity prices gradually recovered ground, the US$ stopped rising&nbsp;the Chinese Renminbi stopped falling and the fears over a looming global recession abated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central banks contributed their part, by either proving that they had by no means run out of monetary policy tools (Eurozone&rsquo;s ECB) or at least would act sensibly and slow their path of normalising interest rates upwards (US Fed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With economic data showing that Global economic development is by no means falling off a cliff,&nbsp;the sentiment from doom and gloom changed to a renewed focus on a resilient, albeit slow economic growth scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the first quarter ended, western equity markets were firmly on course for a full recovery, while from the perspective of a weakened &pound;-Sterling, Global stock markets as represented by the MSCI World index even recorded a slight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best performers of the quarter were commodities, although that was more as a counter-reaction to their haemorrhaging declines previously, rather than a fundamental change in direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest return surprise perhaps was the strong performance of the government bonds. Their overvalued prices were first pushed up by investors seeking their relative safety after stock markets began to crumble and then when equities began to recover they didn&rsquo;t fall back as a consequence of the continued monetary easing support of central banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We felt that the January and February market correction was unjustified from the perspective of a fairly resilient global economy, but that the correction came not entirely unexpected, as such market upheavals have historically often accompanied the change towards monetary policy tightening as initiated in late December by the US Feds first interest rise in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the market unease was around fears that rapid changes in currency values between the US$ and the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) during 2016 could seriously disrupt flows of capital. Therefore, the most reassuring observation of the outcomes of the first quarter of 2016 is not that equities have broadly recovered, but that the US$ has stopped and reversed its 3 year uptrend and that equally&nbsp;the Chinese Renminbi is no longer depreciating. This has the potential to put some of the more serious market concerns to rest and should lead to a positive Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the general market nervousness has not gone away and for all those who believe that the V-shaped market recovery was merely a reaction to the stabilising oil and commodity prices, a renewed sell-off is possible if commodity prices decline again. This could happen as there remains a commodity supply surplus over demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime our focus will be on the movement in Sterling against other currencies and&nbsp;government&nbsp;gilt markets, whose valuations are now once again at odds with an improved economic outlook. We are concerned that in the run up to the European Referendum, the economic uncertainty of a leave vote will cause UK and European markets to become very sensitive.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,194,194,'und',0,'<p>Concerns about the closeness of the UK referendum on EU membership are starting to dampen business and consumer confidence. Recent surveys have shown that UK households are optimistic about their personal finances but expectations for the wider economy, due to the uncertainty of the EU referendum, have fallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government figures have confirmed that the UK economy expanded by 0.6% in Q1 2016 matching the growth we achieved in Q4 2015. The economy&rsquo;s strength was supported by higher consumer spending and business investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) confirmed that the UK current account deficit has recently surged to a record high and The Bank of England (BoE) warning that the rising current account shortfall is leaving our economy vulnerable in the event of a UK Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deficit is the gap between money coming in and out of the country. This gap rose to 7% of GDP in Q4 2015. This deficit has been progressively rising over the past four years and last year stood at 5.2%. This recent rise is the highest since the end of World War 2. No other country in the OECD has such a high current account deficit as Britain. Economists feel that the current account deficit is now so large that it leaves the UK vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main reasons that this deficit has grown is down to the large number of FTSE 100 companies involved in energy and mining that have repatriated much reduced oversees profits. It is likely that this commodity driven downturn will recover. However,&nbsp; recovery will be dependent upon OPEC oil production rates, US interest rates and China consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK current account deficit is evidence of us as a nation living beyond our means and in need of foreign capital to support consumption. BoE Governor Mark Carney has indicated that the UK economy remains heavily reliant on foreign investment which helps plug our current account deficit.&nbsp; Global investors have so far chosen to overlook the deterioration in the current account due to the attractiveness of London and the UK as a whole. This may change as June 23rd draws nearer and polls tightening. Foreign investment is assuming that the British people will do the rational thing and stay within the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists now believe that if the UK were to pull out of the EU, the economy may face a sudden decline as inward investment into the UK could significantly fall. In turn the value of &pound; Sterling would fall reflecting the resultant low demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The possibility that Britain may opt out of Europe will inevitable rattle markets. &pound; Sterling has lost ground by 9% since late 2015 and UK gilt spreads have been increasing. This is always an early sign of concerns and the pricing in of risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no sovereign debt crisis looming as we borrow in &pound; Sterling. We could let our exchange rate take the strain by devaluing our way out of any immediate trouble. Unfortunately a Britex will compound this problem significantly and holding a referendum when we have a historically high current account deficit is not good planning.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

With people living longer and recessions regularly reminding us that we&rsquo;re not always going to have an easy ride, everyone should have a retirement plan that looks beyond state provision as a reliable source of pension income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our financial advisers have a wealth of experience of helping clients properly plan for retirement and will be happy to guide you through the number of pension savings options available. We&rsquo;ll take the time to understand your circumstances and help you choose arrangements that best suit your needs &ndash; including advice on when you should start making arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estate Capital provide advice on all of the products listed below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Retirement Income Forecasts&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Personal Pensions&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs)&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Small Self-Administered Pension Scheme (SSAS)&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Occupational Final Salary Pension Transfers&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Occupational Money Purchase Pension Transfers&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Pension Fund Consolidation&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Flexi-Access Drawdown Accounts&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Conventional Annuities&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>With Profit &amp;&nbsp;Unit Linked Annuities&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Enhanced Annuities for those with Impaired Health&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Auto-Enrolment Schemes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tax Relief on Pension Contributions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the initial attractions for investing into a pension fund is that all contributions, up to the annual limits, attract tax relief. This means basic rate tax payers only pay 80% for their pension, while higher rate tax payers only pay 60%. The difference is made up in tax relief claimed back from HMRC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers that make pension contributions can also claim full corporation tax relief on payments into directors or staff pension schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tax-Free Compounding Growth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributions into pensions can be invested in a wide range of assets. Pensions can hold simple cash funds all the way to speculative assets. The growth of these assets will be aided by the fact that no capital gains tax applies to pension fund assets &ndash; meaning that pensions grow predominantly tax-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a great benefit of starting to build a pension fund as early as possible. Retirement funds will benefit from the combination of tax relief and tax-free compounding growth. Most of the value in a pension fund at retirement is built up from long-term savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guaranteed Income or Flexible Income</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of options that are now available to people at retirement is wider and more flexible than ever. People can access their retirement savings between ages 55 and 75. Funds can be converted into a guaranteed income for life or retained to provide a more flexible income.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Multi-Generational Inheritance Tax-Free Asset</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People who elect to enjoy a flexible income arrangement are able to pass their funds on their death, to their spouse, children or even grandchildren. Pension funds once seen as retirement assets only are now legacy assets that multi-generations can enjoy free of inheritance tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New Pension Freedoms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2015 the new pension freedoms were introduced, giving pension fund owners far greater flexibility and access than ever before. With these new retirement benefit freedoms comes responsibility to ensure that your largest asset in used wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pension funds can now be converted to cash at retirement in full or in part, fund a flexible level of ongoing income or be passed down to your spouse, children or grandchildren as a legacy asset &ndash; choices unheard of previously. And, with these new choices comes the need for professional advice to guide you through the range of options available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our financial advisers have a wealth of experience helping clients with their pensions and retirement planning. We can help you build and benefit from pension funds. We believe it&rsquo;s important that you to have confidence in your pension arrangements and the peace-of-mind to enjoy life to the full.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Retirement Planning &ndash; About to Retire?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After planning for security and comfort in your retirement, and having spent years building up your nest egg, it&rsquo;s important to get the most from your pension fund.

The executor of a will or administrator of the estate must pay the tax using funds from the estate. Currently, the tax comes at a cost of 40% on anything above the threshold &ndash; making inheritance tax, potentially, the largest tax demand your estate will ever face.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comprehensive Advice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Inheritance tax is sometimes put on the backburner, either because people don&#39;t like to think about what will happen to their estate after they die, or because they don&#39;t believe they need to consider it yet. However, it&#39;s always best to start your inheritance tax planning as early as possible, so you&#39;re privy to the broadest range of options available to you and able to make informed decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a number of factors influencing the value of your estate and the bill that eventually hits your beneficiaries; some comprehensive calculations are required in order to best manage your affairs upon your death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inheritance Tax Exempt Arrangements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Estate Capital can help you decide who you want to offer gifts towards, when you might want to start gifting, and how frequently &ndash; whether you wish to gift directly or use the range of inheritance tax efficient trusts that are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may wish to reduce a inheritance tax liability by considering inheritance tax exempt investments or make provisions for your children to have the means to pay the eventual tax bill through a Whole of Life Assurance.

	('node','page',0,23,23,'und',0,'<h2>Management of Exchange Traded Funds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth in the Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) sector has been remarkable since their introduction in the USA in 1993. The number of ETFs in issue continues to grow every year with 8845 ETFs now available to UK investors. These ETFs track the performance of nearly every stock market, sub sector stock market, bond market and commodity market across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like index tracking passive funds, ETFs offer investors a single investment that replicates the component assets and performance of a selected index.&nbsp;ETFs provide diversification across an entire index guarding against single stock volatility. Management fees are typically lower due to the simple index replication nature of investment research.&nbsp;The index approach benefits from low operating costs and competitive performance when compared to the majority of actively managed investment funds over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are Exchange Traded Funds?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) as the name suggests are funds that trade on a stock exchange. ETFs are pooled investment funds that are regulated under the European Union&rsquo;s UCITS regime allowing ETFs to be bought and sold on all European Stock Markets.&nbsp;ETFs are continuously priced open ended index funds and as such trade throughout the day. An ETF can be purchased at a known price at any time instead of only once a day like OEIC and Unit Trusts. The open ended nature of an ETF also allows for the creation and redemption of shares in order to meet investor demand. ETF trading settlement times are quicker. A sell and buy strategy can be simultaneously executed keeping investors in the market. OEIC and Unit Trusts investors have to wait until a sale is settled to reinvest which usually means four or five days out of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to these characteristics ETFs uniquely provide two sources of liquidity.&nbsp;The primary market offers liquidity through the ETF issuer and Authorised Participants creating and redeeming ETF securities to meet investor demand just like other open ended funds.&nbsp;The secondary market offers liquidity through tradable securities on the stock exchange just like closed end funds.&nbsp;This double layer of liquidity makes ETFs easy to trade and therefore usually track very closely the value of the underlying index.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Index Representation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally in order to replicate an index such as the FTSE 100 Index, an index fund would purchase all the underlying physical securities in line with their index weighting. However, this is not always practical so a fund may just buy a range of selected securities. This process is called optimisation and is used when an index is hard to replicate. A fund will instead purchase a representative subset of securities, usually ones that have a strong correlation with the index.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Purchase</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retail index tracking funds are usually purchased from a fund manager via an investment platform. ETF trade on a stock exchange and therefore are available to buy or sell via a stockbroker or stockbroker platform at market prices. The ETF share price is available throughout the day and is influenced by the share price movement of the underlying securities, currency exchange rate movement for international index funds and investor demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange can be used as an asset within an ISA, Pension Fund or Life Insurance Offshore Bond.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Suitability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ETFs often benefit from lower operating costs and expense ratios compared to OEIC index funds. However, as ETFs are purchased as a security that is traded on a stock exchange they carry additional up front stockbroking purchase costs and a trading spread. Therefore, the holding period of an ETF becomes important in order for the lower annual management costs to overcome the transactional charges. For this reason, ETFs are usually more cost effective for larger lump sum investment. Investors making regular or frequent small contributions would be better suited to OEICs or Unit Trusts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors seeking to create a well-diversified portfolio may be suited to a broad range of ETFs that track the indexes of differing asset classes, sectors or regions. ETFs often hold hundreds or even thousands of individual securities so a single ETF can instantly diversify a portfolio into a particular asset class, sector or region into which the ETF invests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no significant difference in taxation between an ETF and an OEIC, unit trust, investment trust or a share. Realised capital gains count against the capital gains allowance. Dividend income will be taxed as income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For EU UCITS purposes ETFs are often domiciled in Ireland. An Ireland domiciled ETF that has &ldquo;reporting or distribution status&rdquo; for tax purposes is treated for capital gains in the same way as other collective investment funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Due Diligence</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal due diligence processes apply to the selection of an ETF just the same as any other fund we would recommend. Unfortunately, the current level of institutional due diligence reporting is not as extensive as it is for OEICs, unit trusts or investment trusts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is common for an ETF to be selected based upon the relevant index and the operational charges. However, such features as tracking methodology and accuracy, the stability and expertise of the provider, excess return and tracking error as well as the security lending policy should be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annualised fund returns are amongst the first measures considered when evaluating investment funds. How well an index fund performs against both its benchmark index and competing products is also important. The excess return tells an investor the extent to which a fund has outperformed or underperformed against its benchmark index. Tracking error is calculated as the annualised standard deviation of excess return. While excess return measures the extent to which an index fund&rsquo;s returns differ from that of its benchmark, the tracking error indicates how much variability exists within the funds excess return data points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If total return is the primary objective then excess return is more important. However, if a consistent performance that matches the index is important then tracking error is relevant. The best scenario would be an ETF with both a high excess return and a low tracking error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Securities lending is the practise of temporary transferring or lending a security by the ETF manager to a third party in exchange for cash that can produce income for the lender. This can be an attractive source of revenue. However, for what is a relatively risk free way to increase returns there can be pitfalls in the form of counterparty risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Management Costs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Management fees for ETFs are lower than actively managed funds as an ETF simply replicates an underlying index and consequently its performance rather than analysing individual stocks to outperform the index. An ETFs total expense ratio (TER) is typically in the range of 0.1% to 0.6% of asset value per annum. Typically, a portfolio of ETFs would cost an average of 0.3% per annum. Added to this cost are the platform custodial costs of around 0.35% of asset value per annum and the investment management fee. The investment management fee is dependent upon the portfolio investment and varies between 0.35% per annum and 0.75% per annum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ETF Strategies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The world&rsquo;s most advanced market for ETFs is the USA. In the US, ETFs are widely used by institutions, advisers and private investors. With the growth in ETFs we have also witnessed the growth of ETF strategists. These wealth management firms have developed new and differing uses and styles of ETF investment to generate alpha returns form these passive beta products. ETF strategists are overtaking traditional stockbroking firms as the main stay of retail wealth management in the USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, at Estate Capital, wish to be at the forefront of these new ETF strategies in order to improve the range of investment options we offer. With this in mind we are currently investing in new and unique academic research into financial forecasting and market timing strategies in order to launch a series of our own ETF strategies in 2016.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

Similarly, it is possible that a previously selected fund may not perform as well as expected or as well as it may have done in the past when it satisfied our selection criteria.

	('node','article',0,108,108,'und',0,'<p>Interest rates in the Eurozone have reached extraordinary low levels. The highly unusual phenomenon of negative bond yields is now common. For example, the 5 year German bunds have been offering a coupon rate below zero. This situation is intensifying the search for income and consequently driving down yields. Investors, including ourselves, bought European corporate bonds in late 2014 in the belief that the start of the ECB &euro;60bn monthly bond purchasing programme in January would eat up bond supply in Europe leading to scarcity and rising values. The situation was suddenly changed when the ECB QE programme reversed the deflationary pressures in the Eurozone far sooner than expected. The new expectations of inflation forced European bond issuers to respond to the change by offering more attractive higher yields. With rising bond yields come a corresponding fall in bond prices. We have therefore witnessed the early but significant signs of distress in European sovereign bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain is still borrowing heavily and servicing an ever-growing debt pile. If the UK gilt market starts to spike, with yields forced to rise as investors demand higher returns to combat eventual inflation and interest rate rises, this could seriously hit the cost of borrowing and impact the economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the election, the 10 year Treasury Gilt gross redemption yields stood at just under 1.9%. Two weeks later, they broke above 2% for the first time in six months with bond values subsequently falling. This was partly due to the recent rebound in oil prices fuelling inflationary expectations, together with a broad sell-off of Eurozone bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign investors have been selling their UK bonds. Non-residents sold a total of &pound;14bn between January and February. This is part of a wider trend as prices of Western sovereign debt have been inflated by printed money, causing a bond bubble that could burst with inflation and interest rate rises. This is why some bond investors have been leaving the market ahead of a potential loss occurring exit and explains why the European bond market has witnessed significant rises and falls recently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The threat of rising bond yields will have a major impact on western governments not least in the UK. Our public finances remain fragile with borrowing of &pound;87bn in 2014/15 and a national debt of &pound;1.5tr, which nearly doubled over the term of the last parliament. Financing the rising cost of this debt will be challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;After a miserable 2014, the Eurozone is growing&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>After a miserable 2014, the Eurozone is growing. European data has been improving prompting economists to review upwards their growth forecasts. The ECB QE monetary stimulus, lower energy prices and improved bank lending levels have already created inflationary pressure. A big turning point for Europe was the end of the European banking asset quality review. European banks have been under pressure to improve Tier 1 capital ratios. By shoring up capital reserves they cut back on lending to the economy. Now, European banks have been given the all clear and therefore have resumed normal lending and are competing for new business which is leading to falling commercial lending rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination of better lending conditions, lower oil prices, and the depreciation of the Euro by 8% since January has increased European output and exports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retail sales and new car registrations rose at a healthy pace suggesting that energy related savings are being spent not saved. With employment rising and wage growth picking up, we expect further solid spending growth this year and next. Lower borrowing costs will also encourage business investment. It is expected that Eurozone GDP will grow 1.6% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. In fact, Europe may be in better shape than is reflected by current markets as monetary policy takes time to filter through into the real economy. After three years of policy easing and now full QE, Europe may well see stronger economic growth and higher inflation than may be currently expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deflationary fears have moved to inflation expectations, credit is flowing more freely and demand from households and companies are on the rise. Consumer confidence is strong despite concerns over Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past five years European company earnings have lagged behind those of the US as America&rsquo;s growth has powered ahead. This is starting to change which bodes well for European equities. Perhaps the most dramatic transformation is that of the Spanish economy. Recent headlines have been about bailouts, crushing unemployment, high bond yields and bank crisis. Now, it is a growing economy with 2.6% GDP growth this year. Spain will grow almost as fast as the UK and a lot faster than France or Germany. Unemployment, thankfully, is starting to fall as manufacturing and exports are up. There is also good news in Italy. The Eurozone&rsquo;s third largest economy is benefiting from the ECB stimulus package, falling oil prices, and at last the easing of austerity measures. The Italians can expect 0.7% growth this year.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,109,109,'und',0,'<p>The UK general election was predicted to be the most uncertain in decades. In the event it was one of the most certain. The run up to the election did affect market outlook particularly with the realistic possibility of a UK government being heavily influenced by nationalist parties. Sterling has soared after the election on the outcome of a majority Conservative government. Sterling made its biggest gains against the US$ in six years breaking the $1.58 mark and its highest value against the euro in seven years reaching &euro;1.40. This represents great value for British holiday makers this summer but also creates difficulties for UK exporters whose products have become more expensive to overseas buyers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most impressive aspects of the UK economic recovery has been the growth in jobs. Our economy has been a very effective job creator. In the past five years two million extra jobs have been filled while the number of unfilled positions stood at 750,000 at the end of May. Unemployment has fallen over the same period from 8% to 5.5%. Full time jobs account for 75% while those employed on flexible contracts, so called zero hour contracts, are around 700,000 in a workforce of over 31 million.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Britain has become an impressive job creator&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 202,000 new jobs created in the UK in Q1. Our employment rate now stands at 73.5% the highest since records began, while the total number of people who are currently unemployed is 1.83 million, the lowest for 7 years. Regular pay awards are now growing at their fastest for 4 years. The annual rate of earnings in the private sector stood at 4.3% while the public sector rose by 0.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest growth sectors have been professional; scientific and technical services, and the high technology sector. Manufacturing employment remains virtually unchanged while construction jobs are surprisingly slightly down. The modern British economy is very service orientated with overseas sales of service almost as big as manufacturing exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain has become an impressive job creator much like the US due to a flexible labour market that supports employment and business friendly economic policies. These features will now remain in place for at least the next five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as UK equity returns are concerned, the FTSE 100 index moved from a 12 month low of 6182 in mid-December to hit a new all-time high of 7103 in late April but has since given up a significant proportion of those gains returning to 6680 in mid-June. The UK index has underperformed many of its global counterparts over the last 9 months largely because the FTSE 100 contains a high proportion of poorly performing mining and energy companies. For example, BP and Royal Dutch Shell were hit by falling oil prices while Anglo American and Rio Tinto were hit by record low iron ore prices. It is for this reason that we remained underweight in the UK over the past six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee has voted again to keep interest rates on hold but has predicted that any pick-up in inflation at the back end of 2015 is likely to put a rate rise back on the agenda. The current rate of 0.5% has now been in place for six years. The last six years have seen real cuts to the incomes of savers. This has had a particular impact on retired savers living off their interest. Mortgage borrowers have benefited as buying a home has never been cheaper from a credit point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This news was announced just before official figures showed that Britain fell into its first period of deflation for 55 years on the back of energy price reductions and an ongoing supermarket price war. The fact that inflation turned negative is not a cause for concern. We are unlikely to see damaging deflation as has haunted Japan over recent decades as inflation is likely to return quite quickly. Oil prices are now around 35% up on their January US$ 48pb low. Global oil supply has been squeezed so prices can now rise again. Q4 could see the combination of rising oil and commodity prices pushing inflation upwards enough to prompt the BoE Monetary Policy Committee into an early review of interest rates. Therefore enjoy the fall in prices while they last.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe BoE is somewhat less optimistic about recovery in Q2 as compared to Q1 and has revised downwards its projections for UK GDP growth. The new forecasts are 2.5% down from 2.9% in 2015 and 2.6% in 2016. The growth forecast has been reduced because of the rise in sterling and the impact that will have on exports, a fall in house construction, and because interest rates may have to rise a little earlier than previously thought. We still expect UK interest rates to stay as they are until Q3 2016 and even beyond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoE is also concerned that many of the new jobs being created are lower skilled and therefore tax revenues may not yet match the rate of growth in job creation. The BoE is expecting workers to become more productive, higher paid resulting in increased tax revenue. We remain optimistic about UK growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government borrowing fell to &pound;6.8bn in April down from &pound;9.3bn a year earlier. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) revised its estimate for a full years borrowing to &pound;87.7bn which is below the government&rsquo;s expectation of &pound;90.3bn. While the deficit has been halved in the last parliament it is still one of the largest in the developed world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Osborne plans to hold a new Budget on 8th July. He is expected to outline his strategy to eliminate the deficit by the end of 2017 and achieve a budget surplus in 2018/19. Perhaps then we can then start to reduce the overall national debt that now stands at &pound;1.487tr representing 80.4% of our annual GDP and costing us all around &pound;52bn per year in interest payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a noticeable increase in bank lending to small business. This is a strong signal that the shortfall of private investment is turning a corner and that credit conditions are improving. Also the number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers has increased amid wider signs of a broader confidence within the UK. In April &pound;7bn of new lending was approved. There was a sharp increase in the amounts savers have deposited into their bank accounts as well as an increase in personal loans. The start of the new tax year in April saw &pound;4.4bn invested in new ISA&rsquo;s and an annual 4.9% increase in personal loan applications. Borrowers are taking advantage of record low interest rates and the signs of economic improvement.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,110,110,'und',0,'<p>Selecting an investment theme that encapsulates the year so far is not a simple task. Financial markets have reacted to the sharpest rise in the US $ for 50 years, the start of large scale quantitative easing (QE) in Europe and Japan, a first quarter slowdown in US growth, a sharp decline and then partial recovery in oil prices, spikes in Eurozone sovereign bond prices and the very real possibility of Greece leaving the Euro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magnitude of these market moving events might explain our prevailing tone of caution as we continue to expect volatility over the next 12 months on the assumption that tighter US monetary policy leads to a rise in bond market and in turn equity market volatility. Again, broad based asset allocation will remain key along with the identification of suitable markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity markets lead by China, India, Japan and Europe hit new highs in Q1. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index returned to levels last seen in the dot com boom of 1999. In the US the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ hit new highs. Meanwhile high quality Eurozone sovereign bonds and corporate bonds moved into negative yield territory before responding to the reversal of deflationary pressure within the Eurozone that pushed yields up and prices down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally we have faith that the world economy is improving aided by European and Japanese QE. For us, equities remain the growth asset along with commercial property. However, as we have witnessed in recent weeks, volatility remains a market feature as stocks have fallen back sharply from their earlier highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several themes will shape the global economy over the next year or so. All of these are supportive of risk assets as economic growth improves, inflation stays low and liquidity remains strong. The challenges for markets will come when the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates, even if this tightening of monetary policy is tempered by ongoing liquidity provision from the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan (BoJ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We felt that at the end of 2014 that the combined impact of lower oil prices and lower interest rates would bring stronger growth and lower inflation in 2015. So far there has been evidence of this but it has been mixed. We have seen positive returns in Europe but so far disappointment in the US. Inflation has fallen in both the US and UK, in fact we have witnessed negative CPI numbers this year whilst Europe has seen an increase in inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slowdown in the energy sector is having a more immediate impact on the US economy than is the boost to consumer spending due to lower energy costs. Very poor weather has also increased energy usage. Nonetheless the fundamentals are in place and with improving income and employment rising, consumption will soon pick up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the start of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the Eurozone and the expansion of QE in Japan, equity growth in these countries has risen in line with that recorded in the US and UK after the start of their respective QE programmes. Part of the current rise in capital values is down to QE but also due to lower energy costs, which have supported growth across the developed world. A stronger US$ and weaker &euro; and &yen; have also skewed growth away from America towards Europe and Japan. It is likely that the Eurozone economy will outpace both the US and UK in the first half of this year. For example, European retail sales volumes are showing a 6% gain year on year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although US growth slowed in Q1, we still expect the Federal Reserve to start raising their interest rates in Q4 this year. This expectation is underpinned by the likelihood of US unemployment rates falling below 5% within the year given the current rate of job growth. There is evidence that wages and employment costs are increasing and while this will not yet translate into higher inflation rates, the Fed does wish to control inflation growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Strengthening US dollar is becoming a significant factor for global growth. The US$ rose 12% in Q1 reflecting growing expectations of US interest rate rises this year. A growing US economy and a strong US$ is good news for exporting economies with US imports up 5% year on year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The strengthening US dollar is becoming a significant factor for global growth&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This broad pattern of recovery in the advanced economies is not extending to emerging markets with the exception of India. The weakness of commodity prices, a downturn in construction and growth in China has influenced emerging markets. An upturn in China is needed to help support a broader emerging market recovery. We expect solid but not spectacular growth from China even though their stock market has had a remarkable year so far. The easing of Chinese monetary policy will cushion a slowdown rather than stimulate growth.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe energy importing emerging markets will benefit from lower oil prices, while the more manufacturing orientated countries in Asia are well placed to benefit from higher consumption in Europe and US. However with the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate rise in the offering there will be increased pressure on emerging markets to finance US$ denominated debt. Therefore focusing on those economies that have strong balance sheets and low external debt like India would be worthwhile. Emerging markets GDP is expected to fall 3.7% this year, the lowest since 2009.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','full_html'),

As the Syriza lead coalition took power in January, Greece was actually starting to enjoy its strongest period of growth since 2008. The economy despite the lack of reform had bottomed and recovery was in progress. It is disappointing to see how quickly that position has been lost. Soon after Alexis Tsipras became Prime Minister, the ECB surprised many by announcing that it would no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral for cheap loans. Greek banks could therefore no longer borrow new money from the ECB, limiting the ECB exposure to Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greece&rsquo;s debt mountain stands at &euro;320bn. The cash strapped government has been struggling since February over the further release of &euro;7.2bn. In June it is due to repay &euro;6.75bn to its principle creditors (ECB, IMF and bond holders), in July &euro;5.95bn and in August &euro;4.38bn. It is the repayment of these loans that are being negotiated without success as yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figures show that private sector bank deposits shrank by &euro;4.6bn in April down to &euro;133bn the lowest since 2004. The people of Greece are withdrawing their savings from their own banks at a phenomenal pace. Since January&rsquo;s general election, &euro;30bn has been withdrawn. So far what has happened is not a full scale run on the banks but it is a fast jog and big enough to cause concern. If Greek citizens take enough money out and banks cannot replace the liquidity with loans from the Bank of Greece then their banks will fail. The ECB are in control of the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). Greek banks have been told that as long as they remain solvent and have adequate collateral they will continue to receive funding. However, with the realistic possibility of Greece leaving the Euro and reinstating the Drachma at a 40%-50% devaluation rate, who would hold their money in Greece?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The likelihood of a forced Greek exit from the Eurozone is higher than ever. It seems clear that Germany in particular is warning Greece &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;. This raises the question of a potential spill over effect into other markets. The risk of default contagion is greatly reduced as compared to the last Grexit threat back in August 2011; Greece is a relatively smaller economy and has greatly reduced its banking sector exposure. The greater risk is a loss of investor confidence but even this has been minimised by the ECB QE programme buying up European corporate bonds. If Greece does exit from the Euro it will be expected that equity and bond markets will see greater global volatility and initial significant losses. However banking contagion should be limited to other peripheral European markets. We do however ultimately expect a classic European and IMF deal to be reached to keep Greece in the Euro, but the chances are reducing by the day as each side becoming more entrenched.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,112,112,'und',0,'<p>The brutal weather in January and February across North East America has once again hit GDP growth. The combination of freezing conditions, a prolonged dock workers strike and a very strong US$ has led to the world&rsquo;s largest economy contracting by &ndash;0.7% in Q1 compared to an expected 0.2% expansion. On the back of a high US$, American exports fell by 14% while imports increased by 5.6%. The trade deficit widened in March by US$15.5bn to US$51.4bn much to do with delayed imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wall St stock value dropped after a weaker than expected US consumer confidence report, flat retail sales in April and May, and lower than expected industrial production.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the slowing of output and GDP, some of the shine has come off US stocks that have enjoyed a terrific run of growth for the past few years. Some economists believe the US economy is running a little hot but consider the recent relapse in Q1 as a temporary blip. Goldman Sachs expects that a surge in delayed imports, low oil prices, low interest rates, high employment and rising wages will see the world&rsquo;s superpower generate further growth. They are predicting a GDP growth figure of 2.9% in Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Department of Labor has confirmed that US unemployment is now 5.5%. This represents a seven year low. Employers in the US created 280,000 new jobs in May on top of the 223,000 new jobs created in April. The March figures were 85,000 which were disappointing, and below expectation, but can be attributed to the seasonally poor weather in the North East. These figures did lead to a fall in US stock values, but the improved April and May figures reversed that decline. While employment growth continues at the current pace, Janet Yellan, the Head of the Federal Reserve, remains on course to raise the federal funds interest rates towards the end of 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an unusual move, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the Federal Reserve to delay any rises in interest rates until 2016 as they believe pockets of vulnerability in the US economy have emerged. Some fund managers are expecting a 2016 start to US interest rate rises. In which case emerging markets will take some comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these signs of growth in the US, we are conscious that American stock markets are currently trading on a price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 27, when the long term mean is 16. We are also mindful that with the wave of cheap money available, equity growth in US corporations is disproportionately being achieved through borrowing, share buy backs, and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) rather than from strong and rising profits. The US is therefore historically overpriced but is enjoying significant momentum due to its status as the first developed economy to emerge from recession.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,113,113,'und',0,'<p>Investors have spent many years wondering why fast economic growth in China was not reflected in strong investment returns. Now, they are wondering how slower economic growth can generate such attractive investment returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Xi Jinping is reforming the economy and turning away from debt funded infrastructure investment to boost growth. A continuation of the 2014 objectives of reform and deleverage will be continued in 2015. We expect China&rsquo;s leaders to manage a slower rate of growth persisting in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower growth makes the operating environment more competitive for many businesses. The best companies, those with higher margins, bigger cash flows, stronger balance sheets and superior management, are using these tighter times to gain a competitive advantage. Businesses with low debt and better operating efficiencies are investing in new products and efficiency gains offering investors attractive growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rise in domestic consumption is the core investment case. With wages and incomes rising, social change and urbanisation is driving a multi-year increase in consumer activity. China is the world&rsquo;s largest importer of oil and therefore should be a net beneficiary of lower energy prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China has reduced its interest rate by 0.25% to a lending rate of 5.1% and a deposit rate of 2.25%. This is the third such reduction in six months following some disappointing results showing weaker than expected exports and foreign trade. Foreign trade fell by 10.9% on a year on year basis as rising labour costs and a relatively strong currency squeezed manufacturing and exports. These rate reductions are therefore aimed at incentivising spending by making it less attractive to leave money in the bank and encouraging business to invest by cutting lending costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data reinforced expectations that China will see its worst annual performance in 25 years. The IMF predict that China&rsquo;s GDP will grow this year at &ldquo;only&rdquo; 6.8%, down from 7.4% last year and greatly reduced from 14.2% in 2007. But, this is a different China and one starting to steer a different course. Government reforms are helping the country transfer itself from an investment and export lead economy to one focused on sustainable but slower domestic consumption lead growth. Economists will agree that 6.8% is still, in global terms, a very attractive growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The volume of trading on China&rsquo;s major exchange has some days reached US$140bn&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the start of the year the Chinese stock market, the Shanghai Index, has risen 37% and its sister index, the Shenzhen is up 53%. Over the past two years the two markets have risen by 122% and 96% respectively. The volume of trading on China&rsquo;s main stock exchange has reached US$140bn on a number of days this year. This is four times greater than Wall St. There are 100 million investment accounts in Shanghai as rapid economic growth over the past decade has created a burgeoning middle class wishing to enter equity markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2011 to 2014 the Chinese stock market hardly moved in value compared to China&rsquo;s economic growth. The main reason being the difficulty foreign investment used to have in participating in China&rsquo;s semi-closed stock market and the preference Chinese people had for investing in homes and property. This sector is now in decline as an asset class due to oversupply and higher credit controls on mortgages. The Chinese stock market took off when the property bubble burst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt would be natural to be concerned that with these growth rates the Chinese equity market itself may be heading for a bubble. P/E ratios are currently up to 20 times earnings which is internationally high but still well below the 40 times earnings of 2007. Some sections of the Chinese stock market do qualify for&nbsp;<br />\r\nthe generally accepted definition of a bubble and&nbsp;are being driven by herd instincts and momentum. We are therefore cautious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of new homes in China fell for the ninth consecutive month in May showing that the property sector continues to be a major drag on the world&rsquo;s second largest economy. Average house prices in China&rsquo;s 70 major cities fell by 6.1% so far this year with a very large inventory of unsold property weighing on the market. The property sector accounts for about 20% of China&rsquo;s economy and is now considered one of China&rsquo;s biggest risks to economic growth. The recent rate reductions may help stimulate demand but some economists are calling for a much bigger rate reduction to at least 2% in order to recover demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been reports that China is about to start its own QE programme but in reality this amounts to the People&rsquo;s Bank of China buying local government bonds only. This is targeted financial assistance to revenue squeezed local government. The property turn down has affected local government bond take up rates.

There are several forces that now should lead to positive long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government policy demands that the Japanese government&rsquo;s pension fund need&rsquo;s to invest tens of billions of &yen; into the Japanese stock market to comply with revised mandates. A quarter of the government&rsquo;s pension fund must now be invested into the domestic equity market. Also the BoJ is expected to invest another US$25bn in QE programmes. The combined impact should be significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the lack of domestic energy resources, Japan&rsquo;s energy imports are one of the highest amongst advanced economies. The reduced cost of oil to industry and manufacturing, as well as the domestic consumer, should drive down costs and increase consumption. Cheaper oil is therefore a tail wind behind Japanese equity growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been far too many past false dawns in Japan and this is the reason that for many years, we have not invested into a Japanese single country equity fund. Given the depth of the country&rsquo;s structural reform that still has to be addressed, it is yet too early to call Abernomics a success. However, attractive valuations, earnings momentum and lose money provide a flexible environment for future growth in this market.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

	('node','article',0,121,121,'und',0,'<p>Government bonds are supposed to be risk-free assets. UK gilts and German bunds being perhaps the most secure. With the ECB starting their &euro;60bn pm QE programme in March, this prompted investors to rush to bonds. The general consensus was that the QE programme would buy up the Eurozone bonds on offer and the resultant scarcity would push up prices even if yields fell to zero. Buyers crowded the small market. Within weeks of the start of Mr Draghi QE programme, the spectre of deflation was removed with low borrowing costs, rising oil prices, and economic growth. Future inflation was back on the agenda and with this yields soared to compensate investors for the risk of future inflation. With rising yields came falling prices. Government bonds have been on a bull market since the early 1980&rsquo;s on the back of low interest rates. Yields have been exceptionally low and hence bond values have been expensive. This is particularly true if yields are less than inflation or near zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent uplift in oil prices and business growth in the Eurozone particularly in Spain eased fears of deflation which Mr Draghi&rsquo;s programme was designed to prevent. If inflation is to return to Europe, zero bond yields are not acceptable and therefore will have to rise. The normally safe and secure government bond market saw ultra-low yields rising by 20% or more with a corresponding fall-off in value. German Bunds, for example, lost 15% in value in early May. Across Europe, sovereign bonds have seen dramatic rises in yields and resulting falls in capital values representing big losses. The sell-off was described by Goldman Sachs as &ldquo;large and vicious&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bond market re-adjustment could signal the end of a 30 year bond bull market as capital values have kept growing on the back of progressively declining yields due to lowering inflation and interest rates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some good reasons to believe that a bear market in bonds may be premature. Investors have not moved out of fixed interest securities and the Eurozone recovery is only just starting. Recent good news in Spain, France and Italy was offset by disappointing news elsewhere. With unemployment still very high we are not likely to see inflation become a problem in Europe for some time. Therefore the ECB are most likely to keep printing money as they have stated, until September 2016 at the earliest. Central Banks are also in no hurry to raise interest rates. This should, going forward, keep the lid on sovereign bond yields and support bond prices. Either way, government bonds remain an unattractive investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major question for bond holders is what will happen once central banks do begin to raise interest rates? The government bonds from countries such as the US, the UK, Germany and Japan all have high credit ratings and therefore yields are determined by the outlook for interest rates. Short duration bonds (less than 10 years) are influenced by current interest rates, while long term bonds are affected by how investors expect rates to change in the years ahead. This is equally true of corporate bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rout in government bond values in May intensified fears amongst analysts over the lack of liquidity in bond markets. A big sell-off in gilts, corporate bonds and high-yield bonds perhaps triggered by the start of potential US interest rate rises in October 2015; ECB tapering QE after September 2016; or the emerging markets struggling with rising US$ values, would create major liquidity problems as sellers crowd the exits.

Their annual allowance will reduce by 50p for every &pound;1 of income in a range between &pound;150,000 and &pound;210,000, so that someone with an income of &pound;210,000 or more will have an annual allowance of &pound;10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government consults on the future of pension tax relief</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pension tax relief rules are complex. Complexity acts as a disincentive if people cannot understand the benefit of saving for their later life. The 12-week consultation does not put forward a specific proposal for reform, instead it is seeking suggestions about whether and how the current system of pension tax relief should be reformed. It is not proposing incentives for pension savings are scrapped altogether, quite the opposite, instead it wants to ensure that the incentives to save for retirement are &ldquo;clear, simple and transparent&rdquo;, ensuring that individuals make sufficient savings for later life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any change will not occur overnight, and the government is clear that it will proceed gradually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxation of lump sum death benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2015, pension savings can be paid out tax-free if a member died before age 75 and the lump sum was paid within two years of the member&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a 45% tax charge applies if the lump sum is paid after two years, or in respect of a member who died after age 75. From April 2016 the tax payable on lump sums paid after two years or post age 75 will be based on the marginal rate of the recipient, with the exception of lump sums paid to non-individuals like Trusts or Companies, for which the rate will remain at 45%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barriers to accessing &lsquo;pension freedoms&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government will consult imminently on options to improve the pension transfer process, aiming to make it quicker and smoother. They confirm that if there is evidence of exit penalties hindering the process, they will act by legislating a cap on early exit penalties for those aged 55 or over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pension Wise access for age 50 upwards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government is extending access to Pension Wise, the free and impartial guidance service, to those aged 50 and above. Having received criticism that Pension Wise is not widely known, a nationwide marketing campaign will be launched to raise awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Secondary annuity market delayed until 2017</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government confirmed the secondary annuity market enabling consumers to sell their annuities for a lump sum will be delayed until 2017. This is to ensure sufficient time to create a market and support service to ensure consumers are making the right decision. Plans for the secondary annuity market will be set out in the Autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Changes to domicile rules</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Permanent non-domicile status to be abolished</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chancellor has today announced changes to the deemed domicile rules, which are due to apply from April 2017. A detailed consultation document will be published after the summer recess on the best way to deliver these reforms. Further consultation will follow on the draft legislation which is intended to form part of the 2016 Finance Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deemed domicile</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 6 April 2017, irrespective of when someone arrived in the UK, those who have been resident in the UK for 15 out of the past 20 (the 15 year rule) tax years will be treated as deemed UK domiciled for all tax purposes. This means that they will no longer be able to use the remittance basis of taxation and will be deemed domicile for IHT purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore someone who has already been in the UK for 15 years, and remains in the UK from the 6 April 2017, will be caught by the new regime and be unable to access the remittance basis. The government will consult on whether split years of UK residence will count towards the &lsquo;15 year rule&rsquo;.<br />\r\nOnce a non-domicile has become deemed domicile under the &rsquo;15 year rule&rsquo; and spends more than 5 years outside the UK, at that point they will lose their deemed domicile status (the &lsquo;five year rule&rsquo;). This is likely only to be relevant for IHT purposes; however there is an increase in the &lsquo;inheritance tax tail&rsquo; from the 6 April 2017, as currently this would only be relevant for four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who had a domicile in the UK at the date of their birth will revert to having a UK domicile for tax purposes whenever they are resident in the UK, even if under general law they acquired a domicile in another country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Domicile of choice changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to align the treatment of UK domiciles and non-domiciles, UK domiciles who leave after 5 April 2017, having been in the UK for more than 15 years, will also be subject to the &lsquo;five year rule&rsquo; even if they intend to emigrate permanently and settle in a particular place on the day of departure. The government will consult on the interactions between the new five year rule and existing three and four year rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Excluded property trusts and non-domiciles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technical note issued as part of the Summer Budget documents &lsquo;technical briefing on Non Dom changes announced at Summer Budget 2015&rsquo; confirmed that the use of excluded property trusts will have the same IHT treatment as at present (except for the 15 out of 20 rule), other than the announcement made in relation to UK residential property, (see below). However, such long-term residents will, from April 2017, be taxed on any benefits, capital or income received from any trusts on a worldwide basis. The government recognises that this is a significant change to the current rules and that changes to trust taxation are complex and will therefore consult on the necessary details. We await the detail of these proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non dom/UK dom consultation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government intends to consult further on the interaction of the various deemed domicile rules for both UK domiciles and non-domiciles and also in relation to the tax treatment of trusts. No date has been indicated for when these consultations will be issued. However, it is proposed that the measures are to be introduced from 6 April 2017and legislated in the Finance Bill 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non dom/IHT residential property changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2017, non-UK domiciled individuals will be liable to UK IHT on UK residential property which is held in an offshore company/partnership or offshore trust. This applies to all UK residential property, whether it is occupied or let and whatever its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This change applies to UK residential property only. The change will not apply to any other UK assets and neither does it change the rules regarding non-UK assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Tax avoidance and tax evasion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tackling offshore evasion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is relevant for financial institutions, tax advisers and other professionals that may be aware of, or may have given advice in respect of, an offshore account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government will legislate in the Summer Finance Bill 2015 to amend Section 222 of the Finance Act 2013. The amendment will allow HM Treasury to oblige financial intermediaries, tax advisers and other professionals to notify their customers/clients that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK will begin to receive information on offshore accounts in 2017 and at the same time will begin to share information with other tax authorities on accounts held in the UK. This will allow HMRC and other tax authorities to check that the right amount of tax is being paid on money held abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HMRC will open a time-limited disclosure facility in early 2016 to allow non-compliant taxpayers to correct their tax affairs under certain terms, before HMRC start to receive data under the Common Reporting Standard. This new facility will be on tougher terms than the previous offshore disclosure facilities HHMRC have operated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If non-compliant taxpayers continue to conceal their tax affairs, HMRC will enforce tough penalties for offshore evasion through the existing offshore penalty regime, new civil penalties for tax evaders, and the new simple criminal offence of failing to declare taxable offshore income and gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HMRC will informally consult financial institutions and tax advisers to develop targeted and cost-effective communications including the points above, and to ensure the right people are involved in delivering the messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulations will be made after the date of Royal Assent to Summer Finance Bill 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Direct recovery of debts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislation will be introduced allowing HMRC to recover tax and tax credit debts directly from debtors&rsquo; bank and building society accounts. Additional safeguards have been included but HMRC will be able to take action against debtors who owe over &pound;1,000, though they will always leave a minimum aggregate of &pound;5,000 across debtors&rsquo; accounts. The measure will introduce the power to recover debt directly from cash held in bank and building society accounts and includes cash in ISAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Marketed avoidance schemes</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government will publish consultations with the intention of introducing legislation in Finance Bill 2016 with regards to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>serial avoiders who persistently enter into tax avoidance schemes that are defeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>general Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) penalty &ndash; to consider introducing a GAAR penalty and new measures to strengthen the GAAR further.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,128,128,'und',0,'<p>In recent weeks all the financial news has been focused upon a solution for the Greek debt crisis. The referendum in Greece followed by the financial and political negotiations in Brussels, has keep this current Greek tragedy on the front pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However a bigger drama has been playing out while being virtually unreported in the UK until this week and that is the spectacular growth and then fall in Chinese stock markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial and investment implications of the events in Shanghai are far more important to the world economy than those of Greece. To put the economies in context, China has 20 cities that are bigger than the whole of Greece and an economy 40 times larger. The fall in Chinese share prices in June were 13 times the size of the Greek economy. The knock on impact of the Chinese stock market losing a third of its value is far more significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebalancing of the Chinese economy from investment and export driven towards domestic consumption is a key pillar of the Beijing reform programme. Part of this programme was the ongoing promotion by the Chinese authorities of property and equity markets in order to create growth and a feel good factor within China. The outcome has been millions of inexperienced private investors pushing up Chinese stocks creating a bubble that has spectacularly burst. The Chinese government were encouraging equity investment right up to the point the market corrected. This has made policy makers look inept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2014, the Shanghai Composite Index stood at 2177 and by early June 2015 had grown 237% to 5166. Seven weeks later it stood at 3725 a fall of 28% including an 8.5% decline suffered on 27th July. This was the sharpest one day fall for eight years despite the Chinese government trying to support the market. This fall sent tremors around the global commodity markets and hit currency values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with these recent falls the Shanghai Composite index is up 170% over one year and up 9.6% since January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is however concern that the Communist Party is losing control of their economy having stoked up a series of asset bubbles, first in residential property and then equities in order to keep up the pace of economic growth. The Chinese stabilisation measures adopted since the first big sell off in June did not work. Commentators think that the Chinese authorities have put a lot of credibility on the line to shore up prices and this credibility has been damaged. The government has already bought $250 bn Chinese equities and has a credit line of $450 bn if necessary. They have also adopted measures to close the market, ban short selling and forced brokerage houses to buy stock. Unfortunately this is leading to a false market, building up unnecessary stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly markets need to settle at levels that can be sustained on fundamental reasons which may well mean the Chinese State swallowing some heavy losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the rest of the world the events in China have much bearing. China consumes 50% of global coal, 43% of industrial metals and 23% of world grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dangers posed specifically by the Chinese stock market falls may well have been over stated. The main concern is the slowing of the real economy and the impact that a lack of Chinese spending is having on the rest of the world particularly the BRIC economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it happens the Chinese stock market is not that significant in relation to China&rsquo;s real economy as for decades the stock market has not mirrored the nations GDP growth. Only 1 in 30 chinese people own shares as compared to 1 in 7 in the USA. For all the 100 million stock broking accounts in Shanghai most are owned by the wealthy and who are unlikely to scale back spending due to stock market falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an inevitable slowing in the rate of growth as a result of China&rsquo;s new higher level of development. The fall off from 14.2% pa GDP growth in 2007 to about 6.8% this year is in line with the experience of other Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However unlike most western countries, the Chinese authorities have plenty of options to support their economy. They have already cut interest rates four times so far this year but still have room to cut further if need be. Their current bank lending rate is 4.85% far higher than that of the West. The nation&rsquo;s banks are still in public ownership and so if the economy were to weaken the authorities could instruct the banks to keep lending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If China is to become a normal economy and realise its full economic potential then the share of the economy based upon private consumption needs to rise from the current 38%. In order for this to happen the share taken up by investment and exports will need to fall. This is a great challenge to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As and when China becomes a consumer society it will have a huge impact on the world. If we just consider tourism a growing industry for Chinese travellers. Currently travel out of China by the Chinese exceeds arrivals into China by 4 to 1 even though only 1 in 20 Chinese have a passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since last autumn when Chinese stock markets were beginning their bull run, there have been warnings of a bubble. Having now corrected, fair value has been restored after the momentum speculation of millions of private investors. We feel that this new fair value could continue to grow for many years but not without some bumps along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As stated before we remain cautious but invested in China as the consumer growth story despite its volatility remains the core investment case.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

Barclays Bank is now predicting a March 2016 rate rise, while some hedge fund managers are calling for the Fed to restart Quantitative easing (QE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The US economy grew by more than expected in Q2 at 3.7% GDP growth, up from 2.3% due to strong consumer and government spending as well as higher export revenue. While the likelihood of a rate rise in September has reduced, these figures will support the Fed in taking action to increase borrowing costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">There is often volatility in markets when a market braces itself for change. It is therefore not surprising this has been happening as we get closer to expected date of a Fed funds rate rise. The US economy has a debt imbalance that the Fed wishes to correct and an economy with enough fundamental strength from jobs growth and a housing recovery to allow for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The dilemma facing Janet Yellan and Mark Carney is that they both wish to end the era of near zero interest rates by slowly and gradually increasing rates. To do this now at a time of deflationary anxiety over the health of the global economy may well turn a significant correction into something worse. We are not expecting the US, as some have called for, to return to QE in order to stimulate growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">This year the US$ has risen in value by 20% over a basket of major currencies.

	('node','article',0,133,133,'und',0,'<p class=\"rtejustify\">From September 2014 through to June 2015, we witnessed a remarkable stock market boom in China. This Bull Run was supported by the further opening of the Chinese stock market to international investment and by the Chinese authority&rsquo;s encouragement of domestic investment. The Shanghai Composite Index started September priced at 2200 points rising to 5166 in mid-June prior to the first market correction. Over the past 8 weeks the index has fallen back to 3232, the level at which it started 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">On 11th August, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) released the Yuan from its US$ peg and devalued the currency by around 2%. The PBoC&rsquo;s action followed a report confirming an 8% drop in Chinese exports and was directly aimed at increasing export demand and improving job creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The implication of this devaluation was that China&rsquo;s economy needed the assistance of a lower exchange rate which caused shock waves in world markets. It was the day that the world realized that deflation was a global threat. Many commentators were taken aback by this move as the devaluation came at the same time as falling stock markets and a major sell off in commodity prices. The exchange rate reduction immediately created fears of a currency and export war which could see competing countries racing to weaken their currencies, driving prices lower and hitting company profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The Shanghai Composite Index suffered its worse one day fall since 2007 loosing 8.5% on &ldquo;Black Monday&rdquo; 24th August and then fell a further 7.6% the next day. Both of these falls came immediately after a week when the Index had already lost 11.5% of its value. The shock of these loses spread across the world, hitting all markets and whipped out all the gains the Shanghai Index has made during 2015. The Dow Jones Index fell 1000 points and the FTSE 100 lost 4.7% of its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">These dramatic declines represented uncertainty, fear of deflation and panic selling. The fact this happened in August, a holiday month, where trade levels are low only made the percentages bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">Western markets have bounced back with stocks recovering most of the week&rsquo;s earlier losses. By Friday 28th the FTSE 100 was back to 6247 having dropped to 5898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The Chinese Authorities must take their share of the blame. They actively stoked up stock market mania in Shanghai, expecting a growing equity market could reflate the Chinese economy. Since the start of the collapse, Beijing has taken action to stabilise the market. They have tightening rules on short selling, banning large shareholders from off-loading stock and forcing national pension funds to buy domestic stock. Despite these high handed anti open market tactics or even because of them the Shanghai Index fell still further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The falls came to an end when the PBoC stepped in with an interest rate cut of 0.25% reducing borrowing costs to 4.6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The events of the last two weeks have been some of the most dramatic of the last seven years with stock market losses around the world flying in the face of a slow but evident global recovery. What is more, the vast majority of economists, investment professionals and commentators did not see this coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">It is clear that overvalued stock prices were suddenly hit by the reality of slowing economic growth and the threat of deflation.&nbsp; Fear of deflation was the result of slowing growth, falling commodity prices and the devaluation in the Yuan. These events cause deflationary pressure which is the last thing a fragile global recovery needs. If Beijing was to further support its export and domestic job market with further devaluation, then the fear of deflation will intensify hitting markets further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The devaluing of a currency exchange at the same time as cutting interest rates as the Chinese authorities have done four times this year does have dangerous consequences particularly in inviting outflows of capital. US$800bn has already left China this year with US$200bn fleeing in July. The PBoC holds US$3.7tr in foreign currency reserves, by far the world&rsquo;s largest, and is burning through these reserves in order to defend its currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">There has been real fear expressed that Beijing has in some way lost control of its plan to manage its objectives of solid growth while also deflating its credit bubble. The recent performance of the stock market should not however be mistaken for the performance of China&rsquo;s real economy. Only 3% of China&rsquo;s population own shares so market losses will not directly affect many. Beijing has certainly made mistakes over trying to control stock market speculation but it does still have a sound grip on the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">There is no doubt that China is slowing, official figures has put GDP growth at 6.8%, however many economists consider actual growth at about 4-5% pa and even this lower growth rate does not justify panic. If China manages a smooth transition to a slower more sustainable economy it is still likely to be fast enough to raise Chinese living standards and domestic consumption. To achieve this many economists are calling for a major blast of fiscal spending. In response, the Chinese government plans to pull forward a raft of spending plans scheduled for 2016 which come on top of a 13% increase in government spending for Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">China industrial sector has slowed this year but there is not a sign of a slump. Industrial output has increased by 6% and retail sales up an encouraging 10.5% this year. Looser monetary policy takes longer to take effect in China than it does in Western economies so this year&rsquo;s interest rate reductions are starting to come through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">China&rsquo;s service sector which is now bigger than its manufacturing sector is looking healthy. The property sector is improving. House prices have risen for the past three months and sales are up 18.9% year on year to July. This is particularly important as the housing market and its related industries comprise 25% of Chinese GDP. House sales values in the largest 44 cities are up 34% in the first half of 2015 compared to 2014. Land acquisition is up a massive 92% on 2014 and construction start-ups up 5.2%. The lowering of interest rates this year has aided this growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The general consensus is that the situation in China is manageable particularly if Beijing accepts the cost and pain of stock market losses and moves swiftly to deal with any bad debt that could spiral in China due to capital outflows and a slowing economy. Fortunately China has a great deal of slack in the system to fall back on.

This referendum will be very important and may not be that far away. Our decision will have far reaching economic impact affecting ourselves and future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key foundation of the EU is the single market, one which promotes the freedom of movement of goods, services, people, and capital. The underlying belief is that a single market helps to underpin prosperity, by fostering competition and ensuring efficient allocation of resources. The single market is assisted by the use of a single currency in 19 of the 28 member states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these founding principles the process of creating a single market in all sectors of the economy is by no means complete. The Euro has been under stain for several years and recently the free movement of labour has also come under pressure. Passport and border controls have been abolished in the Schengen Area, which comprises of 22 of the EU member countries along with Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. However Germany has recently brought back border controls with Austria after large numbers of migrants from war torn Syrian travelled from Hungary via Austria into south Germany. The UK along with Ireland negotiated to opt out of the Schengen Area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK Currently accounts for 12.5% of the EU population and 15% of its GDP. We import 9.3% of EU imports and export 6.3% of all EU exports.&nbsp; We are the fourth largest net contributor to the EU budget after Germany, France and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last financial year 2014/15 the UK&rsquo;s net payment after rebates and EU receipts was &pound;9bn about 0.46% of UK GDP. It is expected to stay at &pound;9bn for the next few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some exponents of a UK exit from the EU claimed in September 2013 that the true cost of EU membership is somewhat different. The full indirect costs were assessed and they overshadow the direct costs substantially. If added to the direct costs, the cost of lost jobs due to immigration, waste, regulation, resource misallocation, fraud and corruption that would mean that the figure rises to a massive 11% of GDP. These figures are, as one might expect, disputed by the pro EU campaign. It should be remembered that these costs do bring benefits to the UK and balancing the two is the assessment that needs to be made in order to come to a reasoned judgement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The share of UK trade with the EU has been declining in recent years but it is still our largest trade partner. Just over 45% of UK exports went to the EU while 50% of imports came the other way in 2014/15. The UK has a growing trade deficit with EU countries but a growing trade surplus with non EU countries. An argument is often made that the UK is hampered in taking advantage of trade outside the EU by virtue of the fact that the EU negotiate on behalf of all members, the trade and tariff terms with the rest of the World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strength of the UK trade with non EU countries may counter that argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 10 years prior to the UK joining the EU in 1973, the UK GDP per capita was weaker than the average of the EU. It has been consistently stronger than the rest since membership in 1973 according to Thomson Reuters. It therefore seems hard to argue that membership has effected growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Conservative government&rsquo;s objective appears to be to secure enough changes in EU law, regulation and practise that would enable the Prime Minister to go to the country with the proposal that the changes negotiated would change the character of the EU sufficiently to justify continued British membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes sought are in four main areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a curb on the rights of immigrant workers to receive UK welfare payments. A four year waiting period before in work benefits are available and the removal of jobseekers benefits if not in work are the conditions sought. Germany and Spain are both seeking similar tightening up of immigrant benefit entitlement. Progress on this issue seems possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, The UK wants to be excluded from the EU objective of &ldquo;ever closer union&rdquo;. Other EU members outside the Eurozone are sympathetic to this objective. By contrast the members of the Eurozone do need ever closer union if the Eurozone is to avoid the kind of crisis that has bedevilled the currency over the past five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, The UK is seeking general improvement in the overall competitiveness of the EU including greater cost cutting and accountability. Germany is particularly sympathetic to this cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourthly, Ministers are concerned that the 19 Eurozone countries will use majority voting in the 28 member EU to change rules to the detriment of non-euro nations. This is especially relevant to financial regulation and the City of London. The UK is seeking binding principles to ensure this does not happen. Unfortunately for Mr Cameron any new rules have to be part of treaties and will not be completed before the UK goes to the polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a range of Brexit scenarios, all with different implications to the UK economy. In September 2015 four economic studies from independent research institutions made predictions that leaving the EU would have a negative impact on UK GDP growth. Each of the studies used different time periods but all had a similar conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial markets, are for the time being, ignoring the risk of a Brexit as so much is still yet to be negotiated. Apart from by the end of 2017 there is little indication as to when the referendum will take place and which post Brexit option the government would take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan Stanley has recently published a 75 page report modelling the impact of the referendum on the UK economy. They have called a 35% probability of a leave vote and a 50% probability of a very close vote. They also predict that UK growth would fall to 1% in 2017/18 and inflation would rise to over the BoE target of 2% with the Government having to cut interest rates to revive the recovery.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

The generosity of final salary pensions, better state pensions and the prudence of the baby boomer generation for saving and paying off debt have made the retired better off than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On average, UK pensioners earn &pound;394 pw compared to &pound;385 pw of the working age population.

Such is the recent advance that 4 out of 10 pensioners earn more in retirement than they did on average through their working life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these &ldquo;baby boomers&rdquo; benefits are encouraging The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that future pensioner wealth could fall within a decade due to financial pressures on the younger generation. These issues include the decline of final salary pensions, the savings gap and the ability to get on the housing ladder. With people now living longer, the overall generosity of the state pension is likely to be paired back as it becomes more expensive to provide. It is predicted that people in their 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s may well end up with lower relative income in retirement than their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Men are now starting to outlive women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The better off males in Britain are now for the first time outliving the average life expectancy of a woman. Over the past 30 years, men have been closing the life expectancy gap with a seven year increase in average male life expectancy. Women have enjoyed a corresponding 4.5 year increase. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that better off males could now expect to live to 82.5 years old which is marginal higher than the average woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longevity figures have been influenced by women working full time and bringing up children.

	('node','article',0,149,149,'und',0,'<p>The great recession of 2008 has led to record peacetime government budget deficits across the developed world. These massive debt piles have highlighted to governments the cost of generous pension and welfare benefit arrangements enacted decades earlier. The impact of the great recession was to erase &pound; trillions in private wealth around the world leaving many with insufficient assets to fully realise the comfortable retirement that they had once expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against a backdrop of people living longer and the current retired generation benefiting more than any before, there is a sense that the relative standards of living will fall for the next and subsequent generations. There are some key factors that will influence whether these senses become a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of these factors is the unprecedented rise in the number of people across the developed world that will enter retirement and the impact that this will have on government spending on health and pensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second factor is who will produce the goods and services in sufficient quantity that these retirees will consume and who will purchase the assets that they may wish to sell to finance their retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been shown that if the developed world wishes to maintain their current retirement ages then they will not be able to rely on their own working population alone to produce the goods they require.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An offsetting force is the strong growth in the more advanced emerging economies of India,China and other Asian countries. They will soon provide the bulk of the world output. The challenge over economic growth and demographics is whether the emerging economies will be productive enough to produce the goods and services to generate sufficient savings to purchase assets from the developed world&rsquo;s new retirees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1946 and 1964 birth rates significantly rose above the average of the previous two decades. The so called &quot;baby boomers&quot; were then followed by a baby bust. In Europe for example average birth rates fell from 2.5 in 1960 to 1.8 in 2010. In the Mediterranean countries it fell below 1.5. In Asia the birth rate per family is even lower. In Japan and South Korea it is 1.3 and in China it is of course just 1. China has recently ended its one child policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research at Cambridge University has illustrated that since 1840 life expectancy in the developed world has increase at a constant rate of 2.5 years per decade. The improvement in mortality rates among the baby boomers combined with the reduction in birth rates has dramatically changed the age distribution of the worlds advanced economies. By 2040 the age profile of Japan, Greece, Spain and Portugal will be inverted. The heaviest population bracket will be people in their 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s with the number over 80 outnumbering children aged under 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the western world there has been a trend of reducing retirement ages. The combined forces of rising life expectancy and falling retirement age will result in a dramatic rise in the number of years the average worker is retired. An increase in retired life is particularly significant as millions of people across the developed world expect to enjoy general good health supported by income benefits provided by the state, corporations or privately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This golden age of increased life expectancy and early retirement cannot continue. As we know in the UK basic state pension ages have already been raised to age 65 for both sexes and then moving both to 66 and then 68.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics from 2013 show that the USA has 28 retires per 100 workers. This is expected to rise to 56 per 100 by 2060. In japan it is 49 per 100 but rising to 113 per 100 by 2060. Across Europe the 2060 figure is predicted to be 76 per 100 workers. These predictions assume a 65 retirement age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the exception of China the rise in the number of retirees in the emerging economies is much more gradual. Between 2015 and 2033, when the vast majority of baby boomers in developed economies will have retired, the number of retirees per 100 workers will have risen from 11 today to only 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This age wave of baby boomers in retirement may have a negative impact on asset values in the future. An increase of retirees could generate an increase in sellers over buyers, a situation that could only depress asset prices. The impact being that future retirees will have to work longer and save more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently about 80% of the world&rsquo;s population live in developing countries. These economies currently produce about 50% of the world&rsquo;s output but this is changing. Since the 1980&rsquo;s the per capital production of the Chinese economy, as measures as a % against US per capita production has risen from a starting point of 2.1%. China has four times the population of US and will become the world&rsquo;s largest economy when the per capital income reaches 25%. This is forecast to happen in 2016. The economy of China is expected to be twice the size of that of the USA by 2025 if both countries per capita income continues as they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth in China&rsquo;s GDP is projected to produce 32% of world output by 2032 but then falling back to 14% by the end of the century. This decline is put down to the one child policy and the long term implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A decade after China started to grow, so started India&rsquo;s economic liberalisation. It is expected that India&rsquo;s GDP growth will surpass China&rsquo;s this year. India&rsquo;s GDP is predicted to exceed the US in the mid 2030&rsquo;s and eventually exceed China. India journey is quite remarkable. It accounted for 3% of world GDP back in 1980 but now produces 6% of global output. It is forecast to grow to 11% by 2032. By 2060 India&rsquo;s economy is expected to be larger than China because of population growth and age demographics. India is predicted to produce about 25% of world GDP by 2040 and maintain that output through the rest of this century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has estimated that the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; as defined as people earning between US$3,650 and US$ 36,500 per annum in emerging economies will increase by more than 3 billion or 170% between 2015 and 2030. While their spending power will increase by 150% rising to over US$34 tn. This is twice the size of the US economy and 80% of that growth is expected in Asia. In contrast the OECD expects that total spending in Western Europe and USA will barely increase over the same timescale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth of the emerging economies has profound and beneficial implications for the developed world. Over the decades ahead, many of the goods required by the retirees of the developed world will be produced by workers in emerging markets. The income earned from selling these goods will support workers savings. Asian&rsquo;s are natural high savers with high national savings ratios. The growth of savings by investors in both developed and emerging economies may result in baby boomers asset value holding up in retirement.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

This sets a clear timeframe for those concerned they may lose out from any reforms to make the most of the current rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pension IHT exemption to be confirmed</strong><br />\r\nThe law will be changed to remove any doubt over the IHT exemption for remaining drawdown funds on death. This change will be backdated to 6 April 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second hand annuity market - more news in December</strong><br />\r\nIndividuals will be allowed to sell their annuity income stream, with details promised next month and legislation scheduled for 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Workplace pensions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Auto-enrolment contribution step-up put back 6 months</strong><br />\r\nIn a welcome break for employers, the phased increases in minimum contributions under auto-enrolment will be delayed by over 6 months. This means the increases scheduled for October 2017 and 2018 will now be delayed until April 2018 and 2019 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Salary sacrifice under scrutiny</strong><br />\r\nContinuing concerns over the growth of salary sacrifice arrangements mean that&nbsp;the Government is gathering evidence to decide whether action is needed to reduce this cost to the Exchequer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>State pensions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New &#39;single-tier&#39; State pension starting figure confirmed as &pound;155.65 a week</strong><br />\r\nThe full rate of the new &#39;single tier&#39; State pension for those reaching State Pension Age from April 2016 has been confirmed as &pound;155.65 a week. This gives future pensioners more clarity over what income they can expect from the State, making it easier to plan their private saving to top this up to meet their aspirations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Basic State pension to go up by 2.9% from April</strong><br />\r\nExisting State pensioners will see the basic State pension increase by &pound;3.35, to &pound;119.30 a week, from April - an inflation-busting rise of almost 2.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buy to let market</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a double blow for buy to let owners. The first piece of bad news is the introduction of an increased rate of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) payable on the purchase of second properties worth more &pound;40,000 from April 2016. An additional 3% will be payable on top of the standard SDLT residential rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in moves to bring tax reporting in to the digital age, CGT payable on second homes will need to be paid within 30 days of a disposal from April 2019. This could bring forward the payment of tax by almost 22 months for some sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, these measures are in addition to the proposals to restrict mortgage interest relief on buy to lets to just basic rate, which were announced in the Summer Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IHT: Deeds of Variation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deeds of variation can be used to alter how an individual&#39;s wealth is distributed after their death. Following a consultation, the government will not be restricting their use at the current time. This means that families can still benefit from the flexibility that a deed of variation can bring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the government will continue to monitor this area, so the ideal position continues to be to get planning right before death. Regular reviews and professional advice remain essential for your clients in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Individual tax allowances and bands 2016/17</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal allowance / Higher rate thresholds<br />\r\nThese will remain at the levels announced in the Summer Budget:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal Allowance increases to &pound;11,000 (from &pound;10,600);<br />\r\nHigher rate threshold increases to &pound;43,000 (from &pound;42,385).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A basic rate taxpayer will be better off by &pound;80. Higher rate taxpayers will be better off by &pound;203.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New dividend allowance</strong><br />\r\nAlso confirmed is the new tax free dividend allowance of &pound;5,000. Dividends in excess of this allowance (and any unused personal allowance) will be taxed at the following rates, depending on which tax band they fall in:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basic rate:&nbsp; 7.5%;<br />\r\nHigher rate:&nbsp; 32.5%;<br />\r\nAdditional rate: &nbsp;38.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correspondingly, the system of dividend tax credits will be abolished from April 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that from April 2016, a basic rate taxpayer could have tax free income of up to &pound;17,000 a year&nbsp;when added to the personal allowance of &pound;11,000 and the new &#39;personal savings allowance&#39; announced in the Spring Budget of &pound;1,000. Higher rate taxpayers could have up to &pound;16,500 (as the personal savings allowance is restricted to &pound;500 for these individuals).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain individuals may also have savings income falling into the &pound;5,000 savings rate &#39;band&#39;, currently taxed at 0%. This band continues unchanged next year, meaning that some individuals may have tax free income of up to &pound;22,000, depending on the sources of their income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ISA annual subscription limits</strong><br />\r\nThese will remain unchanged from this year at &pound;15,240 for an ISA, and &pound;4,080 for a Junior ISA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The limits normally increase in line with CPI, measured each year in September. In September 2015, inflation was flat, which is why there will be no increase in the limits for 2016/17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confirmation of allowances and tax bands means that taxpayers can plan ahead with some certainty.

	('node','article',0,155,155,'und',0,'<p>After the dramatic falls in equity markets in August, stock market volatility extended throughout September. These market falls contributed to the worst quarter in global stock markets since quarter 3 of 2011 and the Eurozone crisis. Confidence in the strength of a global recovery was hit by Chinese data that suggested that their economic activity had fallen. The subsequent official Chinese government intervention in both the foreign exchange and stock markets only exacerbated the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August&rsquo;s devaluation of the Chinese renminbi was a major event and a significant departure by Chinese policy makers. This devaluation was part of a currency war aimed at supporting the competitiveness of Chinese exports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market anxiety almost reached a panic when the Shanghai Composite Index fell by 42% over a horrendous ten week period. Things look quite different now with the index recovering 17% from its August low and up 25% on its value twelve months ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Federal Reserve also contributed to the uncertainty by putting off its decision to raise the federal funds rate in September. Global jitters and some soft data on US job creation meant that dearer money was postponed. This caused investors to ask questions of whether the Fed knew something that they didn&rsquo;t, rather than being pleased that near zero rates had been maintained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding the upturn in volatility in the past six months, the ending of quantitative easing (QE) in the US has been taken relatively well by markets. This reaction is encouraging as the withdrawal of loose money and the December rise in US interest rates further illustrate the growing confidence in the US recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US economy remains flexible and entrepreneurial with better demographics than many of its Asian and European counterparts. The low cost of oil and the development of domestic shale gas will provide low cost energy and a competitive advantage for many years to come. Countries that control their own energy costs, as Britain did during the industrial revolution, have built-in economic advantages.&nbsp;<br />\r\nRecent actions from the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have provided massive monetary easing on an unprecedented scale for these areas. The respective QE programmes are aimed at currency devaluation to create greater export competitiveness. It remains to be seen if central banks in competing countries, adversely affected by these moves, will respond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central banks now have far less ability to respond to adverse economic shocks when their interest rates are at near zero and having already implemented extensive QE programmes. A central bank &ldquo;put&rdquo; where monetary policy can underpin growth, is now less credible and less functional.<br />\r\nSince 2008 we have witnessed hundreds of interest rate cuts and trillions of US$ worth of QE. Still, it feels as though all we have to show for it is a fairly underwhelming stop-start recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the great sell off in August markets have significantly picked up. It is becoming clear that Chinese growth is due to bounce back and markets are positive about the Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December. The postponement of a US interest rate rise in September and the continuation of BoJ and ECB QE have maintained the loose money conditions that have historically lifted stock prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Global growth is holding up better than many commentators&nbsp;had expected&rsquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A global manufacturing recovery has started to emerge in Europe, the US and Japan and is starting to shake off the recession scare of the summer. Chinese data has improved after a deep summer slump in industrial output. Fears in August of the world being dragged into a deflationary cycle, which prompted the heavy market falls, now seem overblown and panic driven as global growth is holding up better than many commentators had expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of global factory output has risen to 51.4 in October fuelled by continuing monetary stimulus. The PMI results improved in the UK, Japan, India, Russia and Vietnam. Chinese PMI for October showed signs of bottoming the cyclical trough. The increase in Chinese PMI was the biggest jump for 15 months and the result of the recent fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts at last feeding through to the real economy. This has also begun to spur on a Chinese housing market revival. The PMI index for the Eurozone rose to 52.3 again lifted by a weaker euro, cheap oil and ECB QE.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','full_html'),

Whether or not this proves to be the correct course of action will be seen in the future, but for now a mini cycle of growth is welcome. China can expect &ldquo;true&rdquo; growth of around 5% this coming year and therefore is not an economy facing collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe, it is hoped that deflation has been held off. The combination of cheap money, cheap oil and a devalued euro are having a positive impact. This position is supported by the ECB continuing its QE programme beyond September 2016. The fiscal squeeze that undermined the Eurozone recovery four years ago is now a memory as Ireland, Spain and Italy are all growing out of austerity measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies in the US have indicated that the austerity policies of the US government from federal through to state and county have reduced national GDP growth by about 1% each year over the past five.

We still do not know how the emerging markets will cope with a US$ rate rise hitting their borrowing costs. There are concerns about a general emerging market decline. We also do not really know if the entire world&rsquo;s debt mountain is stable. Central banks may come to realise that they have over stimulated and reflated markets long after it was needed. This is an issue that both Janet Yellen and Mark Carney are currently wrestling with. The US Federal Reserve has started to return to normalised interest rates with a rate rise of 0.25% in December.

Therefore, the strength of the US$ has squeezed US exports and company earnings. The other issue impacting earnings growth is falling oil prices.

The US economy is at a stage of the business cycle where companies can no longer maintain earnings growth through these activities. What they really need is sales growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the strongest aspects of the US economy are consumer spending and corporate balance sheets. Both will continue to support economic activity in 2016.

The increase in M&amp;A activity is expected to last well into 2016. M&amp;A activity is a classic late cycle activity producing growth through acquisition rather than sales growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fundamentally, dwindling profits and earnings growth do not justify the high price to earnings ratios that are common in large US companies.

This fall into negative inflation was put down to lower petrol prices. Core inflation (which does not include volatile food and energy prices) held steady at 1%. Lower prices have put more money into people&rsquo;s pockets particularly when accompanied by wage growth. This increase in household earnings is supporting consumer confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is expecting continued steady growth from the UK. It has predicted that output will grow by 2.5% for 2015 and 2.8% in 2016. Britain is fortunately not just relying on cheap money for this growth. There is plenty of organic momentum. Consumer&rsquo;s real income is rising with wage growth of 2.9%, the fastest rise in six years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has, however, struck a more cautious note and downgraded its forecasts for the UK economy due to uncertain trading conditions.

The UK steel industry has been affected by global overcapacity, high electricity costs and EU limits on state aid to iron and steel companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign investment plays a big part in UK manufacturing with global businesses wanting access to Europe through a country with low corporation tax and flexible labour laws.

For example, the Markit Purchase Managers Index (PMI) across the world was showing an increase in confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However just as we saw last summer, China&rsquo;s volatile stock market has spooked investors around the world. A key question is whether investors have over-reacted to reasons for the falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first week of trading was affected by lower than expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI data for December. The index fell from its pre-Christmas levels indicating a fall in confidence. Another factor effecting stock market sentiment was the end to a ban on selling shares by major Chinese shareholders. This was not an issue about the state of the economy, but shareholders taking profit from the autumn rally when they had the chance to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most concerning event was the Chines central bank allowing the Renminbi to devalue against the US$. The Peoples Bank of China (PBC) reduced its daily rate for the Renminbi by 0.5% which is the largest downward move since last Augusts 2% devaluation. That devaluation resulted in major stock market losses. The PCB later hinted that it could allow the Renminbi/US$ exchange rate to be determined by the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implication of China devaluing its currency in response to other central banks that have devalued their own currencies through rate reductions or quantitative easing (QE) is one of global deflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, the Chinese authorities spent US$ 120bn of their foreign currency reserves. This is massive state intervention to defend the exchange rate. The intervention sought to protect the Renminbi against the ever strengthening US$ and stem capital outflows from China. Chinese foreign currency reserves have fallen from US$ 4tn to US$ 3.33tn. They are using up their reserves at an alarming rate and are getting closer to the US$ 2.6tn deemed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be the prudent level given China&rsquo;s US $1.2tn domestic liabilities and the size of its economy. At current spending rates China has six months before China&rsquo;s once mighty arsenal of capital looks a little inadequate. The authorities are caught between monetary tightening which is the result of selling reserves and maintain the strength of its currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Global markets are acutely sensitive to any signs that China may abandon its defence of the Renminbi, while any currency war would damage global growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese stock market is largely uncorrelated to the real China economy. When the stock market doubled in value last year only then to give up those gains, neither really represented the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Chinese economy. Chinese GDP growth is largely unchanged. We know the economy is inevitable slowing but it is not coming to a haul. The old manufacturing heartlands are in decline but the service sector new economies remain strong. China is about both of these sectors. The transition from export to investment led consumption is progressing but clearly not smoothly. This progress can offer excellent investment opportunities for stock pickers but these opportunities are currently being undermined by a lack of confidence in the overall economy and competence of the Chinese authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets have taken the December rise in US interest rates very well and the rise has in turn strengthen the US$. Any currency devaluation will increase the relative value of US$ and as commodities are priced in US$ will impact on commodity prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a general expectation that the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee will progressively increase US interest rates by small increments throughout 2016, starting perhaps in March or June. However, any slowing of the global recovery may have the effect of delaying such increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aspect of the US economy that is proving resilient is the level of new jobs being created. The US added 292,000 new jobs in December, &nbsp;which was significantly higher than economists had predicted. In 2015, 2.65 million new jobs were created and is evidence of the growing strength of the US recovery. The Fed is expecting new job growth to continue throughout 2016 with Janet Yellen suggesting that the US may create full employment by 2017. These job growth figures are a vindication to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s much debated decision to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has hit its lowest price per barrel at US$32 since April 2002. The falls are due to a lack of global growth resulting in reduced demand and a massive oversupply in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renewed tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia would have in the past put pressure on oil prices. This time there appears to be an expectation that rather than hostilities in the Middle East, the more likely outcome is the intensification of the oil price war further undermining OPEC&#39;s price cartel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia currency, the Riyal, came under pressure last week as the price of oil fell to a US$32pb. Any devaluation of the Riyal could spark a wave of deflation and protectionist policies within the global economy. Saudi Arabia is the world largest producer of crude oil and has a war chest of foreign currency reserves to use to defend its currency. However, the falling price of oil has seen these reserves fall from US$732 last year, down to US$623 indicating the cost of maintaining high oil production and a low oil price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investment Bank Goldman Sachs has warned that despite Beijing&rsquo;s efforts to prop up their currency, the PBC may be forced to abandon its support and allow devaluation. Just as the US and Europe sought to recover from the financial crisis through currency devaluation, reduced interest rates and quantitative easing, the fear is now that even the mighty China with its massive foreign currency reserves may need to do the same. The implications are significant to world markets as currency devaluation will create deflation but reduced interest rates and QE will support real asset values.</p>\r\n','full_html'),

	('node','article',0,175,175,'und',0,'<p>Over the first three weeks of January, we have witnessed a stock market where fear has fed fear. Markets suffered another panic attack at the beginning of last week, with further falls in oil prices being the trigger. Oil slid to a 12 year low of $28pb after the International Energy Agency said that the world &ldquo;could drown in oversupply&rdquo; now that Iranian crude returns to the market.&nbsp; The ensuing rush to sell on world markets created a dynamic of its own which is hard to gauge and even harder to rationalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many economists have commented upon the herd like mentality effecting investors which pushes down asset prices and which itself becomes counterproductive and self-fulfilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outlook is unusually uncertain but if we do step back there is no real change in the already known growth patterns of the USA and China and that low oil prices are usually good for consumers, manufacturing and transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many UK companies across differing sectors are voicing concern over whether they will hit their earnings forecasts and as a consequence issuing warnings of a downgrade in profits. Business, particularly the energy sector, is being affected by a cocktail of uncertainty over the falling oil prices, slowing Chinese growth and any further rises in US interest rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the recent announcement of Chinese GDP growth &ldquo;officially&rdquo; falling to 6.9% in 2015 from 7.3% in 2014, China still consumed 10.32 million barrels of oil last year. Chinese oil use rose by 2.5% and even&nbsp; with growth likely to fall, Chinese demand for crude oil is set to grow by 1.5% this coming year. Therefore it is not a lack of Chinese demand that is hitting the oil price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual World Economic Forum in Davos gives economists, business leaders and world institutions a chance to discuss the economic expectations for the year ahead. Interestingly even after the stock market volatility in recent weeks, most delegates still expect a continuation of gradual economic expansion and see a low likelihood of a market crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One attendee that did not share this view was George Soros. The billionaire currency trader warned of financial turmoil, a hard landing for debt laden China and the spread of deflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets gained some much needed relief at the end of last week with the belief that central banks will now provide some fresh support. On Tuesday after the Chinese GDP growth figures for 2015 were announced, the Chinese authorities confirmed their awareness of the formidable challenges ahead of them in order to rebalance their economy and their determination to fully address these issues. With large parts of the Chinese economy still state owned as well as the entire banking system, the country has the means to control a gradual slowdown. Much does depend upon how well China manages its slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMF has recently reassessed its growth forecasts and confirmed that its estimate for Chinese GDP growth in 2016 will remain at 6.3%. China was one of the few countries not to be given a growth downgrade for 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday at the European Central Bank (ECB) monthly press conference, President Mario Draghi hinted that the ECB would expand their monetary easing program from March onwards if market action lead to deterioration in the economic outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECB inflation target is 2% pa and is currently running at 0.2%, way below this target. Back in December Mr Draghi said he expected Eurozone inflation to reach 1% in 2016. He made this prediction assuming oil would be priced at an average of US$50pb and it now stands below US$30pb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Draghi comments last week were interpreted as meaning that the ECB will take further action over Quantitative Easing to stimulate inflation and counter the fall in oil price. His comments calmed the stock market with shares rising across the world. On Friday major stocks markets gained between 2% and 6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reaction to the announcements by the Peoples Bank of China (PBC) and the ECB indicates that the markets are concerned that central banks may be misjudging the continued fragility of economic expansion and have tightened monetary conditions prematurely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World stock markets have been particularly turbulent since the US Federal Reserve increased US interest rates in December and perhaps that is no coincidence after initially responding positively to the rise. European Investment Bank UBS has suggested that the Federal Reserve must also come out and reassure the markets. UBS feels that the Fed needs to cool expectations of how quickly it will move in delivering successive rate rises. This would send a positive message to the market as further rate rises would be damaging. All eyes are therefore on Janet Yellen to see what the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s response will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see there being three key headwinds in 2016, namely the deflationary impact of falling commodity prices, the credit stress in emerging markets following the US interest rate rise and the slowdown in China and the currency control of the Renminbi. Co-ordinated reassurances by the major central banks that they will manage monetary policy with close regard to these challenges is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of last week there was a noticeable change in investor mood. Many technical indicators moved from sell to buy with investors sensing a barging in the &ldquo;January Sales&rdquo; with markets so depressed. We therefore hope we have seen an end of this correction. The change in pulse has made us more confident of a market recovery. If the selloff in early January was psychologically driven rather than reflect the fundamentals of the global economy, prices should rebound as they did last October after Augusts sell off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do however remain cautious, particularly over the implications of a slowing China and the levels of capital leaving the country. This is placing strong downward pressure on the Renminbi. Any resultant devaluation will transfer deflation to the West via lower import prices. America and Europe are therefore under threat of deflationary pressures hitting growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','full_html'),

Gold a safe havens in times of market turbulence reached an eight month high of US$1,239 per ounce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen informed Congress that the recent rout in global stock markets has forced the Fed to delay any further rises in US interest rates, which up until the start of the year were expected as part of a gradual plan to bring US interest rates back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Dr Yellen&rsquo;s comments did little to support markets as traders around the world sold off stock. Last week had an eerie feel of last August about it when fears over China&rsquo;s currency and stock market spilled into the rest of the world&rsquo;s markets. We see traders sell down prices not because of a significant change in the fundamentals but a fear of the unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts are putting the falls down to falling oil prices, slowing growth in China, spikes in the value of the &yen; and weak US economic data. &nbsp;Realistically none of these issues alone should account for the level of losses. The concerns over the stability of European banks may well have been the actual trigger. This was centred on the prospect of negative interest rates and the bearish sentiment of the general state of Europe&rsquo;s banking system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure centred on Germany&rsquo;s largest bank - Deutsche Bank. The banks credit default swaps, which value the cost of insuring the bank against bankruptcy, hit levels not seen since the 2012 Euro crisis. With global growth stalling, it is inevitable that banks will be under scrutiny with markets increasingly worried about central banks&rsquo; ongoing ability to continue to stimulate growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The negative interest rates imposed by several central banks including Japan and Sweden are making it more difficult for retail banks to build capital reserves and make profit from lending. Banks earn much of their profits from lending at higher rates than they borrow at but at zero interest rates there is less scope for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With central banks charging retail banks for &ldquo;parking&rdquo; their cash, banks are loath to pass this cost onto customers. Instead they are charging more for lending which is then tightening credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deutsche Bank saw it shares fall by 15% early last week but then bounced back by 12% on Wednesday after Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany&rsquo;s Finance Minister said he &ldquo;had no concerns about Deutsche&rdquo; and that Deutsche Bank paid back &euro;3bn of euro bonds and $ 2bn of dollar bonds to relieve market worries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Deutsche Bank may be making substantial losses it is nowhere close to triggering a write down of its contingent convertible bonds and that in this case investors got a severe case of the jitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Banks are stress tested by the European Central Bank (ECB) but not as rigorously as the Bank of England (BoE) has done in the UK mainly as there are so many more banking institutions to regulate. However, unlike their American counterparts, European banks still hold some bad debt festering on their balance sheets. In the past the ECB has supported the European banks with repeated injections of liquidity to keep even the poorer banks afloat. Now the reality of negative interest rates is making them face a commercial reality and force them to restructure their businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments from Germany&rsquo;s bankers generally do not believe that the wider economy is in trouble yet, but do fear that panic can spread in a self-fulfilling way. They feel that a panic can hurt the short term outlook even if the fundamentals do not really justify such damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A useful counterpoint to the concerns of a down turn was the release of January&rsquo;s forward looking Purchase Managers Index (PMI) figures for many countries and sectors. The PMI is a snapshot of business expectations with readings over 50 indicating a positive outlook. Results for the developed world averaged 52.1 while the emerging world averaged 49.3 with Brazil and Russia in particular bringing down the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed markets seem to be continuing on their path of healing, led by solid performances in the service sector while those emerging markets mainly exposed to commodity exports have experienced a real slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These PMI results are at similar levels to Q4 of 2015 before the recent market falls and indicates that in the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo; not that much has changed and certainly nothing that would justify the selloff we witnessed last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important change is that the markets over the past three weeks appear to have taken seriously the major central banks resolve to keep economic expansion on track. Last week this manifested itself in a fall in the US$ while the Chinese Renminbi gained, leading to an upward movement in commodity and oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the week the majority of markets had enjoyed a relief rally and put back on 2.5% to 3%.

This close correlation really does not make sense as the overwhelming majority of global companies benefit from cheaper oil. There are far more oil consumers than producers.

If the outflows are largely to pay off US$ denominated debt then this is both useful and beneficial particularly if the US does reduce dollar liquidity.

	('node','article',0,186,186,'und',0,'<p>During the first week of March, stock markets continued their recovery despite Chinese macro-economic data releases failing to impress and European updates being only marginally better than expected. The drivers were oil prices rising back to $39pb and robust economic data for the US economy, including very strong new job numbers clearly showing that the US economy is not heading into recession. This insight may have also contributed to the mid-week turn in the bond markets, where long term bond yields finally followed the lead from the stock markets and cautiously rebounded from the previously extremely low levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial bounce from the mid-Feb lows has, over the past 2 weeks, turned into a more pronounced market recovery, akin to that of October 2015 &ndash; which followed a similarly severe sell-off.&nbsp; The markets were most probably wrong in pricing in a severe economic downturn in January and February, but the excessive media focus on all the things that might go wrong and undermine the economy did result in a vicious circle, which did not help improve the generally weak business sentiment towards investment and growth. Furthermore, the strong US employment and decent economic data increase once again the prospects of further rate rises by the US Fed in the near term, whereas the markets have currently not priced in the next move until the autumn.

Read our summary of the details that may be relevant to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Income Tax</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Personal allowance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax-free personal allowance is being increased to &pound;11,000 in 2016-17, and &pound;11,500 in 2017-18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For higher rate taxpayers, the government will also increase the threshold above which higher earners start paying 40% tax. It will increase to &pound;43,000 in 2016-17, and to &pound;45,000 in 2017-18.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>ISAs</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lifetime ISA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall ISA subscription limit is being increased from &pound;15,240 to &pound;20,000 with effect from 6 April 2017. The Government has also announced a new Lifetime ISA for those aged between 18 and 40 which will become available from April 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifetime ISA is a new ISA and will sit alongside the Cash, Stocks and Shares and Innovative Finance ISAs. &nbsp;Qualifying investments in a Lifetime ISA will be the same as for a cash or stocks and shares ISA.&nbsp; The rules will in most ways be identical to opening a regular ISA and individuals will be able to open more than one Lifetime ISA during their lives but will only be able to pay into one Lifetime ISA in each tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new ISA will allow savers to contribute up to &pound;4,000 each tax year (within the overall annual subscription) and receive a 25% bonus on those contributions from the government at the end of each tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bonus will be payable by the Government annually to allow for investors to benefit from the tax-free growth on the bonus from the time it is added.&nbsp; The bonus will be limited to &pound;1,000 maximum each year but will only apply until the investor attains age 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors can choose to withdraw their funds to purchase their first home or to retain their investment until age 60 for retirement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifetime ISA will interact with the Help to Buy ISA and during 2017-18 only, additional transfers may be made and matched from the Help to Buy: ISA. &nbsp;Going forward if you have both types of ISA you cannot use the Government bonus from both accounts to put towards your first house purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government is going to explore with the industry whether there should be the flexibility to borrow funds from the Lifetime ISA without incurring a charge if the borrowed funds are fully repaid. In the US for example, some retirement plans allow 50% to be borrowed up to a maximum of $50,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislation for the Lifetime ISA is expected in the autumn following engagement with the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ISA tax advantages during the administration of a deceased&rsquo;s estate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has confirmed that they will legislate to allow the ISA savings of a deceased person to continue to benefit from tax advantages during the administration of their estate.&nbsp; Further plans will follow technical consultation with ISA providers. (Finance Bill 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic deduction of savings income tax:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has announced its intention to change the tax rules so that interest from Open-Ended Investment Companies, authorized unit trusts, investment trust companies and peer-to-peer loans may be paid without deduction of income tax from April 2017. (Finance Bill 2017)</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>CGT rates</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CGT rates will reduce from 18%&nbsp; to 10% (basic rate) and 28% to 20% (higher rate) for chargeable gains, except those made in relation to chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of residential property (that do not qualify for private residence relief), and receipt of carried interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provisions will also make clear that a residential property interest includes an interest in land that has, at any time in the person&rsquo;s ownership, consisted of or included a dwelling, and an interest in land subsisting under a contract for an off-plan purchase. Rules will set out how gains should be calculated in the case of mixed use properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trustee rate of CGT will also be reduced to 20% unless the gain is from residential property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no change to the 10% rate available for gains qualifying for Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CGT &ndash; Lifetime limit on Employee Shareholder Status exemption</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifetime limit of &pound;100,000 on CGT exempt gains that a person can make on the disposal of shares acquired under Employee Shareholder Agreements entered into after 16 March 2016. Gains made in excess of the lifetime limit will be chargeable to CGT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For transfers between spouses or civil partners, the transfer will be treated as being for consideration, therefore the gain will count against the transferor&rsquo;s unused lifetime limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the rate of tax is remaining unchanged, a number of changes in relation to the definition of qualifying gain will be introduced. At a high level these are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>long term investors - external investors in unlisted trading companies will be eligible if held for 3 years+ i.e. no longer need to be employed by the company<br />\r\ntreatment of joint ventures and partnerships - new definitions applying to individuals and trustees who realise gains on shares in a company which invests in a joint venture company<br />\r\ngoodwill on incorporation - to allow&nbsp;Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief to be claimed in respect of gains on the goodwill of a business<br />\r\nassociated disposals - allows Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Relief to be claimed on an &lsquo;associated disposal&rsquo; of a privately-held asset when the accompanying disposal of business assets is to a family member</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Pensions</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lifetime Allowance to reduce from &pound;1,250,000 to &pound;1,000,000</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A member of a registered pension scheme can currently crystallise up to a value of &pound;1,250,000 (Lifetime Allowance) and not be subject to any additional tax charges. Usually, 25% of the payment can be taken tax-free with the balance taxable as income. This limit for the Lifetime Allowance will reduce to &pound;1,000,000 in 2016/17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lifetime Allowance is currently scheduled to begin to rise in line with the consumers prices index (CPI) from 06/04/2018</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fixed Protection 2016 and Individual Protection 2016</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As applied in previous tax years when the Lifetime Allowance was reduced, the government is introducing new forms of protection for those close to the current Lifetime Allowance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be two new forms of protection:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual Protection 2016<br />\r\nFixed Protection 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tapered annual allowance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For anyone who has not triggered the money purchase annual allowance, the standard annual allowance will be &pound;40,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for higher earners, the annual allowance will be reduced if a member&rsquo;s threshold income is above &pound;110,000 and their adjusted income is above &pound;150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual allowance reduction is &pound;1 for every &pound;2 that the adjusted income exceeds &pound;150,000, subject to a maximum reduction of &pound;30,000, i.e. an annual allowance of &pound;10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a client has any unused annual allowance from any of the previous three tax years, this can also be carried forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp; Changes to death benefit taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If a member of a registered pension scheme (RPS) dies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) on, or after, their 75th birthday; and<br />\r\nb) the death benefit is not paid to a UK charity within two years of the date that the scheme administrator became aware of the member&rsquo;s death, any payment to a &lsquo;qualifying person&rsquo; (i.e. an individual in their own capacity) would be taxed at the recipient&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate(s) using the pay as you earn (PAYE) system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pensions tax relief</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No change to the existing pension tax relief system announced, but we don&rsquo;t think further reform is off the table permanently. A new Lifetime ISA has been announced but does not seem to impact the current pension&rsquo;s tax regime. However, it may lead to younger individuals without a mortgage opting out of their automatic enrolment scheme in favour of saving for their first property.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Salary Sacrifice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government confirmed that income tax and National Insurance Contribution relief provided through salary sacrifice will continue for pension savings and other benefits, for example childcare and health-related benefits. However, it may restrict the range of other benefits that can be provided through salary sacrifice arrangements. This is a sensible approach and is good news for working families and pension savers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Serious ill-health lump sum (SIHLS) taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government will alter the tax treatment of a SIHLS to bring it into line with the way that lump sum death benefits are taxed. This means a SIHLS will be tax-free when someone aged under 75 has less than a year to live but has already accessed their pension. A SIHLS will be taxable at the member&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate(s) if the member is aged at least 75.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Corporation Tax</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporation tax will be reduced to 17% in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stamp duty land tax changes &ndash; additional residential properties&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Following consultation, the following changes will apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specified timescale&nbsp;will increase from 18 months to 36 months<br />\r\nThe higher rates will apply equally to all purchasers without an exemption for significant investors.&nbsp;<br />\r\nMarried couples who are living separately in circumstances that are likely to become permanent will not be treated as one unit.<br />\r\nA small share (50% or less) in a single property which has been inherited within 36 months prior to the transaction will not be considered an additional property.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stamp duty land tax changes &ndash; commercial properties&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From 17 March 2016 the rates will apply to the value of property over each tax band. The new rates and tax bands will be 0% for the portion of the transaction up to &pound;150,000; 2% between &pound;150,001 and &pound;250,000 and 5% above &pound;250,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Non Domicile Taxation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was announced in 2015 that Non-UK domicile taxation will be changing.&nbsp; In summary:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An individual will be deemed UK domicile for tax purposes after they are resident for 15 of the past 20 tax years; and<br />\r\nIndividuals who were born in the UK and have a UK domicile of origin will revert to UK domiciled status for tax purposes whilst they are resident in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No additional announcements were made in this Budget.&nbsp; Legislation for these changes will be introduced in 2017 and include charges&nbsp;to UK Inheritance tax on UK residential property held, from April 2017, in&nbsp; an offshore structure such as a trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tax avoidance and tax evasion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Government will issue a number of consultations in the summer of 2017 which propose introducing the principle that the issuance of licenses&nbsp;and access to services be conditional on being registered for tax in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, a new legal requirement will be introduced in 2017 to correct past offshore non-compliance. Tough sanctions will be introduced for those who do not make such correction.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,190,190,'und',0,'<p>After last week&rsquo;s budget there are a few things we have learnt about Chancellors George Osbornes intentions over key tax and financial planning matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that after all the media comment and rumour on the changes to higher rate tax relief on pension contributions that where subsequently dropped that Mr Osborne is not finished on pension reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The significant rise in the annual ISA allowance to &pound;20,000 is interesting. ISA are popular and simple and this rise is a welcome particularly to those high earners who will suffer a reduction in their annual pension allowance from &pound;40,000 down to &pound;10,000 this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However it is the Lifetime ISA (LISA) that is more interesting. If you are a 20% tax payer, the &pound;100 tax you get back for every &pound;400 invested makes the LISA tax free on the way in and on the way out. We think we can expect Mr Osborne to progressively expand the LISA so that it becomes for the under 40&rsquo;s the first choice for savings. The Chancellors desire to avoid paying out higher rate relief on pensions will be aided by the popularity of the new LISA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The under 40&rsquo;s may prefer a LISA to a pension in their early saving years and therefore not start a pension until they are in their 40&rsquo;s. This may have a significant impact on early and important pension savings and workplace pensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those under 40 now thinking about accessing a pension fund at age 55 this may change with the new LISA only being available at age 60 (unless it is used to purchase a home).&nbsp; It is likely that the access age for both will become 60.</p>\r\n','full_html'),
	('node','article',0,193,193,'und',0,'<p>The first quarter of 2016 will go down in market history as the most pronounced V-shaped recovery ever recorded in the first quarter of a year. Fears over both the slowing global economic growth and that central banks may have run out of policy tools to stem a renewed economic slowdown&nbsp;caused the worst Q1 stock market sell off recorded for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By February 11th developed world stock markets had lost between 10 and 20% in value and where thus hovering in the territory between severe correction (-10%) and full blown bear market (-20%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the mood and momentum turned as oil and commodity prices gradually recovered ground, the US$ stopped rising&nbsp;the Chinese Renminbi stopped falling and the fears over a looming global recession abated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central banks contributed their part, by either proving that they had by no means run out of monetary policy tools (Eurozone&rsquo;s ECB) or at least would act sensibly and slow their path of normalising interest rates upwards (US Fed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With economic data showing that Global economic development is by no means falling off a cliff,&nbsp;the sentiment from doom and gloom changed to a renewed focus on a resilient, albeit slow economic growth scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the first quarter ended, western equity markets were firmly on course for a full recovery, while from the perspective of a weakened &pound;-Sterling, Global stock markets as represented by the MSCI World index even recorded a slight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best performers of the quarter were commodities, although that was more as a counter-reaction to their haemorrhaging declines previously, rather than a fundamental change in direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest return surprise perhaps was the strong performance of the government bonds. Their overvalued prices were first pushed up by investors seeking their relative safety after stock markets began to crumble and then when equities began to recover they didn&rsquo;t fall back as a consequence of the continued monetary easing support of central banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We felt that the January and February market correction was unjustified from the perspective of a fairly resilient global economy, but that the correction came not entirely unexpected, as such market upheavals have historically often accompanied the change towards monetary policy tightening as initiated in late December by the US Feds first interest rise in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the market unease was around fears that rapid changes in currency values between the US$ and the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) during 2016 could seriously disrupt flows of capital. Therefore, the most reassuring observation of the outcomes of the first quarter of 2016 is not that equities have broadly recovered, but that the US$ has stopped and reversed its 3 year uptrend and that equally&nbsp;the Chinese Renminbi is no longer depreciating. This has the potential to put some of the more serious market concerns to rest and should lead to a positive Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the general market nervousness has not gone away and for all those who believe that the V-shaped market recovery was merely a reaction to the stabilising oil and commodity prices, a renewed sell-off is possible if commodity prices decline again. This could happen as there remains a commodity supply surplus over demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime our focus will be on the movement in Sterling against other currencies and&nbsp;government&nbsp;gilt markets, whose valuations are now once again at odds with an improved economic outlook.

	('node','article',0,194,194,'und',0,'<p>Concerns about the closeness of the UK referendum on EU membership are starting to dampen business and consumer confidence. Recent surveys have shown that UK households are optimistic about their personal finances but expectations for the wider economy, due to the uncertainty of the EU referendum, have fallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government figures have confirmed that the UK economy expanded by 0.6% in Q1 2016 matching the growth we achieved in Q4 2015. The economy&rsquo;s strength was supported by higher consumer spending and business investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) confirmed that the UK current account deficit has recently surged to a record high and The Bank of England (BoE) warning that the rising current account shortfall is leaving our economy vulnerable in the event of a UK Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deficit is the gap between money coming in and out of the country. This gap rose to 7% of GDP in Q4 2015. This deficit has been progressively rising over the past four years and last year stood at 5.2%. This recent rise is the highest since the end of World War 2. No other country in the OECD has such a high current account deficit as Britain. Economists feel that the current account deficit is now so large that it leaves the UK vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main reasons that this deficit has grown is down to the large number of FTSE 100 companies involved in energy and mining that have repatriated much reduced oversees profits. It is likely that this commodity driven downturn will recover. However,&nbsp; recovery will be dependent upon OPEC oil production rates, US interest rates and China consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK current account deficit is evidence of us as a nation living beyond our means and in need of foreign capital to support consumption. BoE Governor Mark Carney has indicated that the UK economy remains heavily reliant on foreign investment which helps plug our current account deficit.&nbsp; Global investors have so far chosen to overlook the deterioration in the current account due to the attractiveness of London and the UK as a whole. This may change as June 23rd draws nearer and polls tightening. Foreign investment is assuming that the British people will do the rational thing and stay within the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists now believe that if the UK were to pull out of the EU, the economy may face a sudden decline as inward investment into the UK could significantly fall.

We could let our exchange rate take the strain by devaluing our way out of any immediate trouble.

	(23,'node',' exchange traded funds management of exchange traded funds the growth in the exchange traded funds etf sector has been remarkable since their introduction in the usa in 1993 the number of etfs in issue continues to grow every year with 8845 etfs now available to uk investors these etfs track the performance of nearly every stock market sub sector stock market bond market and commodity market across the globe just like index tracking passive funds etfs offer investors a single investment that replicates the component assets and performance of a selected index etfs provide diversification across an entire index guarding against single stock volatility management fees are typically lower due to the simple index replication nature of investment research the index approach benefits from low operating costs and competitive performance when compared to the majority of actively managed investment funds over time what are exchange traded funds  exchange traded funds etf as the name suggests are funds that trade on a stock exchange etfs are pooled investment funds that are regulated under the european union s ucits regime allowing etfs to be bought and sold on all european stock markets etfs are continuously priced open ended index funds and as such trade throughout the day an etf can be purchased at a known price at any time instead of only once a day like oeic and unit trusts the open ended nature of an etf also allows for the creation and redemption of shares in order to meet investor demand etf trading settlement times are quicker a sell and buy strategy can be simultaneously executed keeping investors in the market oeic and unit trusts investors have to wait until a sale is settled to reinvest which usually means four or five days out of the market due to these characteristics etfs uniquely provide two sources of liquidity the primary market offers liquidity through the etf issuer and authorised participants creating and redeeming etf securities to meet investor demand just like other open ended funds the secondary market offers liquidity through tradable securities on the stock exchange just like closed end funds this double layer of liquidity makes etfs easy to trade and therefore usually track very closely the value of the underlying index index representation traditionally in order to replicate an index such as the ftse 100 index an index fund would purchase all the underlying physical securities in line with their index weighting however this is not always practical so a fund may just buy a range of selected securities this process is called optimisation and is used when an index is hard to replicate a fund will instead purchase a representative subset of securities usually ones that have a strong correlation with the index etf purchase retail index tracking funds are usually purchased from a fund manager via an investment platform etf trade on a stock exchange and therefore are available to buy or sell via a stockbroker or stockbroker platform at market prices the etf share price is available throughout the day and is influenced by the share price movement of the underlying securities currency exchange rate movement for international index funds and investor demand any etfs listed on the london stock exchange can be used as an asset within an isa pension fund or life insurance offshore bond etf suitability etfs often benefit from lower operating costs and expense ratios compared to oeic index funds however as etfs are purchased as a security that is traded on a stock exchange they carry additional up front stockbroking purchase costs and a trading spread therefore the holding period of an etf becomes important in order for the lower annual management costs to overcome the transactional charges for this reason etfs are usually more cost effective for larger lump sum investment investors making regular or frequent small contributions would be better suited to oeics or unit trusts investors seeking to create a welldiversified portfolio may be suited to a broad range of etfs that track the indexes of differing asset classes sectors or regions etfs often hold hundreds or even thousands of individual securities so a single etf can instantly diversify a portfolio into a particular asset class sector or region into which the etf invests etf taxation there is no significant difference in taxation between an etf and an oeic unit trust investment trust or a share realised capital gains count against the capital gains allowance dividend income will be taxed as income for eu ucits purposes etfs are often domiciled in ireland an ireland domiciled etf that has reporting or distribution status for tax purposes is treated for capital gains in the same way as other collective investment funds etf due diligence normal due diligence processes apply to the selection of an etf just the same as any other fund we would recommend unfortunately the current level of institutional due diligence reporting is not as extensive as it is for oeics unit trusts or investment trusts it is common for an etf to be selected based upon the relevant index and the operational charges however such features as tracking methodology and accuracy the stability and expertise of the provider excess return and tracking error as well as the security lending policy should be considered annualised fund returns are amongst the first measures considered when evaluating investment funds how well an index fund performs against both its benchmark index and competing products is also important the excess return tells an investor the extent to which a fund has outperformed or underperformed against its benchmark index tracking error is calculated as the annualised standard deviation of excess return while excess return measures the extent to which an index fund s returns differ from that of its benchmark the tracking error indicates how much variability exists within the funds excess return data points if total return is the primary objective then excess return is more important however if a consistent performance that matches the index is important then tracking error is relevant the best scenario would be an etf with both a high excess return and a low tracking error securities lending is the practise of temporary transferring or lending a security by the etf manager to a third party in exchange for cash that can produce income for the lender this can be an attractive source of revenue however for what is a relatively risk free way to increase returns there can be pitfalls in the form of counterparty risk etf management costs management fees for etfs are lower than actively managed funds as an etf simply replicates an underlying index and consequently its performance rather than analysing individual stocks to outperform the index an etfs total expense ratio ter is typically in the range of 1 to 6 of asset value per annum typically a portfolio of etfs would cost an average of 3 per annum added to this cost are the platform custodial costs of around 35 of asset value per annum and the investment management fee the investment management fee is dependent upon the portfolio investment and varies between 35 per annum and 75 per annum etf strategies the world s most advanced market for etfs is the usa in the us etfs are widely used by institutions advisers and private investors with the growth in etfs we have also witnessed the growth of etf strategists these wealth management firms have developed new and differing uses and styles of etf investment to generate alpha returns form these passive beta products etf strategists are overtaking traditional stockbroking firms as the main stay of retail wealth management in the usa we at estate capital wish to be at the forefront of these new etf strategies in order to improve the range of investment options we offer with this in mind we are currently investing in new and unique academic research into financial forecasting and market timing strategies in order to launch a series of our own etf strategies in 2016  ',0),

extraordinary low levels the highly unusual phenomenon of negative bond yields is now common for example the 5 year german bunds have been offering a coupon rate below zero this situation is intensifying the search for income and consequently driving down yields investors including ourselves bought european corporate bonds in late 2014 in the belief that the start of the ecb EU60bn monthly bond purchasing programme in january would eat up bond supply in europe leading to scarcity and rising values the situation was suddenly changed when the ecb qe programme reversed the deflationary pressures in the eurozone far sooner than expected the new expectations of inflation forced european bond issuers to respond to the change by offering more attractive higher yields with rising bond yields come a corresponding fall in bond prices we have therefore witnessed the early but significant signs of distress in european sovereign bonds britain is still borrowing heavily and servicing an evergrowing debt pile if the uk gilt market starts to spike with yields forced to rise as investors demand higher returns to combat eventual inflation and interest rate rises this could seriously hit the cost of borrowing and impact the economic recovery prior to the election the 10 year treasury gilt gross redemption yields stood at just under 19 two weeks later they broke above 2 for the first time in six months with bond values subsequently falling this was partly due to the recent rebound in oil prices fuelling inflationary expectations together with a broad selloff of eurozone bonds foreign investors have been selling their uk bonds nonresidents sold a total of PS14bn between january and february this is part of a wider trend as prices of western sovereign debt have been inflated by printed money causing a bond bubble that could burst with inflation and interest rate rises this is why some bond investors have been leaving the market ahead of a potential loss occurring exit and explains why the european bond market has witnessed significant rises and falls recently the threat of rising bond yields will have a major impact on western governments not least in the uk our public finances remain fragile with borrowing of PS87bn in 201415 and a national debt of PS15tr which nearly doubled over the term of the last parliament financing the rising cost of this debt will be challenging after a miserable 2014 the eurozone is growing after a miserable 2014 the eurozone is growing european data has been improving prompting economists to review upwards their growth forecasts the ecb qe monetary stimulus lower energy prices and improved bank lending levels have already created inflationary pressure a big turning point for europe was the end of the european banking asset quality review european banks have been under pressure to improve tier 1 capital ratios by shoring up capital reserves they cut back on lending to the economy now european banks have been given the all clear and therefore have resumed normal lending and are competing for new business which is leading to falling commercial lending rates the combination of better lending conditions lower oil prices and the depreciation of the euro by 8 since january has increased european output and exports retail sales and new car registrations rose at a healthy pace suggesting that energy related savings are being spent not saved with employment rising and wage growth picking up we expect further solid spending growth this year and next lower borrowing costs will also encourage business investment it is expected that eurozone gdp will grow 16 in 2015 and 18 in 2016 in fact europe may be in better shape than is reflected by current markets as monetary policy takes time to filter through into the real economy after three years of policy easing and now full qe europe may well see stronger economic growth and higher inflation than may be currently expected deflationary fears have moved to inflation expectations credit is flowing more freely and demand from households and companies are on the rise consumer confidence is strong despite concerns over greece over the past five years european company earnings have lagged behind those of the us as america s growth has powered ahead this is starting to change which bodes well for european equities perhaps the most dramatic transformation is that of the spanish economy recent headlines have been about bailouts crushing unemployment high bond yields and bank crisis now it is a growing economy with 26 gdp growth this year spain will grow almost as fast as the uk and a lot faster than france or germany unemployment thankfully is starting to fall as manufacturing and exports are up there is also good news in italy the eurozone s third largest economy is benefiting from the ecb stimulus package falling oil prices and at last the easing of austerity measures the italians can expect 7 growth this year

	(109,'node',' sterling has soared after the uk general election sterling has soared after the uk general election 8072015 170002 the uk general election was predicted to be the most uncertain in decades in the event it was one of the most certain the run up to the election did affect market outlook particularly with the realistic possibility of a uk government being heavily influenced by nationalist parties sterling has soared after the election on the outcome of a majority conservative government sterling made its biggest gains against the us in six years breaking the 158 mark and its highest value against the euro in seven years reaching EU140 this represents great value for british holiday makers this summer but also creates difficulties for uk exporters whose products have become more expensive to overseas buyers one of the most impressive aspects of the uk economic recovery has been the growth in jobs our economy has been a very effective job creator in the past five years two million extra jobs have been filled while the number of unfilled positions stood at 750000 at the end of may unemployment has fallen over the same period from 8 to 55 full time jobs account for 75 while those employed on flexible contracts so called zero hour contracts are around 700000 in a workforce of over 31 million britain has become an impressive job creator there were 202000 new jobs created in the uk in q1 our employment rate now stands at 735 the highest since records began while the total number of people who are currently unemployed is 183 million the lowest for 7 years regular pay awards are now growing at their fastest for 4 years the annual rate of earnings in the private sector stood at 43 while the public sector rose by 9 the largest growth sectors have been professional scientific and technical services and the high technology sector manufacturing employment remains virtually unchanged while construction jobs are surprisingly slightly down the modern british economy is very service orientated with overseas sales of service almost as big as manufacturing exports britain has become an impressive job creator much like the us due to a flexible labour market that supports employment and business friendly economic policies these features will now remain in place for at least the next five years as far as uk equity returns are concerned the ftse 100 index moved from a 12 month low of 6182 in middecember to hit a new alltime high of 7103 in late april but has since given up a significant proportion of those gains returning to 6680 in midjune the uk index has underperformed many of its global counterparts over the last 9 months largely because the ftse 100 contains a high proportion of poorly performing mining and energy companies for example bp and royal dutch shell were hit by falling oil prices while anglo american and rio tinto were hit by record low iron ore prices it is for this reason that we remained underweight in the uk over the past six months the bank of england boe monetary policy committee has voted again to keep interest rates on hold but has predicted that any pickup in inflation at the back end of 2015 is likely to put a rate rise back on the agenda the current rate of 5 has now been in place for six years the last six years have seen real cuts to the incomes of savers this has had a particular impact on retired savers living off their interest mortgage borrowers have benefited as buying a home has never been cheaper from a credit point of view this news was announced just before official figures showed that britain fell into its first period of deflation for 55 years on the back of energy price reductions and an ongoing supermarket price war the fact that inflation turned negative is not a cause for concern we are unlikely to see damaging deflation as has haunted japan over recent decades as inflation is likely to return quite quickly oil prices are now around 35 up on their january us 48pb low global oil supply has been squeezed so prices can now rise again q4 could see the combination of rising oil and commodity prices pushing inflation upwards enough to prompt the boe monetary policy committee into an early review of interest rates therefore enjoy the fall in prices while they last the boe is somewhat less optimistic about recovery in q2 as compared to q1 and has revised downwards its projections for uk gdp growth the new forecasts are 25 down from 29 in 2015 and 26 in 2016 the growth forecast has been reduced because of the rise in sterling and the impact that will have on exports a fall in house construction and because interest rates may have to rise a little earlier than previously thought we still expect uk interest rates to stay as they are until q3 2016 and even beyond the boe is also concerned that many of the new jobs being created are lower skilled and therefore tax revenues may not yet match the rate of growth in job creation the boe is expecting workers to become more productive higher paid resulting in increased tax revenue we remain optimistic about uk growth government borrowing fell to PS68bn in april down from PS93bn a year earlier the office of national statistics ons revised its estimate for a full years borrowing to PS877bn which is below the government s expectation of PS903bn while the deficit has been halved in the last parliament it is still one of the largest in the developed world george osborne plans to hold a new budget on 8th july he is expected to outline his strategy to eliminate the deficit by the end of 2017 and achieve a budget surplus in 201819 perhaps then we can then start to reduce the overall national debt that now stands at PS1487tr representing 804 of our annual gdp and costing us all around PS52bn per year in interest payments there has been a noticeable increase in bank lending to small business this is a strong signal that the shortfall of private investment is turning a corner and that credit conditions are improving also the number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers has increased amid wider signs of a broader confidence within the uk in april PS7bn of new lending was approved there was a sharp increase in the amounts savers have deposited into their bank accounts as well as an increase in personal loans the start of the new tax year in april saw PS44bn invested in new isa s and an annual 49 increase in personal loan applications borrowers are taking advantage of record low interest rates and the signs of economic improvement investment outlook ',0),
	(110,'node',' several events will shape the global economy several events will shape the global economy 6 days ago selecting an investment theme that encapsulates the year so far is not a simple task financial markets have reacted to the sharpest rise in the us for 50 years the start of large scale quantitative easing qe in europe and japan a first quarter slowdown in us growth a sharp decline and then partial recovery in oil prices spikes in eurozone sovereign bond prices and the very real possibility of greece leaving the euro the magnitude of these market moving events might explain our prevailing tone of caution as we continue to expect volatility over the next 12 months on the assumption that tighter us monetary policy leads to a rise in bond market and in turn equity market volatility again broad based asset allocation will remain key along with the identification of suitable markets equity markets lead by china india japan and europe hit new highs in q1 in the uk the ftse 100 index returned to levels last seen in the dot com boom of 1999 in the us the s p 500 and nasdaq hit new highs meanwhile high quality eurozone sovereign bonds and corporate bonds moved into negative yield territory before responding to the reversal of deflationary pressure within the eurozone that pushed yields up and prices down generally we have faith that the world economy is improving aided by european and japanese qe for us equities remain the growth asset along with commercial property however as we have witnessed in recent weeks volatility remains a market feature as stocks have fallen back sharply from their earlier highs several themes will shape the global economy over the next year or so all of these are supportive of risk assets as economic growth improves inflation stays low and liquidity remains strong the challenges for markets will come when the us federal reserve raise interest rates even if this tightening of monetary policy is tempered by ongoing liquidity provision from the european central bank ecb and bank of japan boj we felt that at the end of 2014 that the combined impact of lower oil prices and lower interest rates would bring stronger growth and lower inflation in 2015 so far there has been evidence of this but it has been mixed we have seen positive returns in europe but so far disappointment in the us inflation has fallen in both the us and uk in fact we have witnessed negative cpi numbers this year whilst europe has seen an increase in inflation the slowdown in the energy sector is having a more immediate impact on the us economy than is the boost to consumer spending due to lower energy costs very poor weather has also increased energy usage nonetheless the fundamentals are in place and with improving income and employment rising consumption will soon pick up with the start of quantitative easing qe in the eurozone and the expansion of qe in japan equity growth in these countries has risen in line with that recorded in the us and uk after the start of their respective qe programmes part of the current rise in capital values is down to qe but also due to lower energy costs which have supported growth across the developed world a stronger us and weaker EU and Y have also skewed growth away from america towards europe and japan it is likely that the eurozone economy will outpace both the us and uk in the first half of this year for example european retail sales volumes are showing a 6 gain year on year although us growth slowed in q1 we still expect the federal reserve to start raising their interest rates in q4 this year this expectation is underpinned by the likelihood of us unemployment rates falling below 5 within the year given the current rate of job growth there is evidence that wages and employment costs are increasing and while this will not yet translate into higher inflation rates the fed does wish to control inflation growth the strengthening us dollar is becoming a significant factor for global growth the us rose 12 in q1 reflecting growing expectations of us interest rate rises this year a growing us economy and a strong us is good news for exporting economies with us imports up 5 year on year the strengthening us dollar is becoming a significant factor for global growth this broad pattern of recovery in the advanced economies is not extending to emerging markets with the exception of india the weakness of commodity prices a downturn in construction and growth in china has influenced emerging markets an upturn in china is needed to help support a broader emerging market recovery we expect solid but not spectacular growth from china even though their stock market has had a remarkable year so far the easing of chinese monetary policy will cushion a slowdown rather than stimulate growth the energy importing emerging markets will benefit from lower oil prices while the more manufacturing orientated countries in asia are well placed to benefit from higher consumption in europe and us however with the likelihood of a federal reserve rate rise in the offering there will be increased pressure on emerging markets to finance us

turning away from debt funded infrastructure investment to boost growth a continuation of the 2014 objectives of reform and deleverage will be continued in 2015 we expect china s leaders to manage a slower rate of growth persisting in the future lower growth makes the operating environment more competitive for many businesses the best companies those with higher margins bigger cash flows stronger balance sheets and superior management are using these tighter times to gain a competitive advantage businesses with low debt and better operating efficiencies are investing in new products and efficiency gains offering investors attractive growth the rise in domestic consumption is the core investment case with wages and incomes rising social change and urbanisation is driving a multiyear increase in consumer activity china is the world s largest importer of oil and therefore should be a net beneficiary of lower energy prices the people s bank of china has reduced its interest rate by 25 to a lending rate of 51 and a deposit rate of 225 this is the third such reduction in six months following some disappointing results showing weaker than expected exports and foreign trade foreign trade fell by 109 on a year on year basis as rising labour costs and a relatively strong currency squeezed manufacturing and exports these rate reductions are therefore aimed at incentivising spending by making it less attractive to leave money in the bank and encouraging business to invest by cutting lending costs the data reinforced expectations that china will see its worst annual performance in 25 years the imf predict that china s gdp will grow this year at only 68 down from 74 last year and greatly reduced from 142 in 2007 but this is a different china and one starting to steer a different

has created a burgeoning middle class wishing to enter equity markets from 2011 to 2014 the chinese stock market hardly moved in value compared to china s economic growth the main reason being the difficulty foreign investment used to have in participating in china s semiclosed stock market and the preference chinese people had for investing in homes and property this sector is now in decline as an asset class due to oversupply and higher credit controls on mortgages the chinese stock market took off when the property bubble burst it would be natural to be concerned that with these growth rates the chinese equity market itself may be heading for a bubble p e ratios are currently up to 20 times earnings which is internationally high but still well below the 40 times earnings of 2007 some sections of the chinese stock market do qualify for the generally accepted definition of a bubble and are being driven by herd instincts and momentum we are therefore cautious the prices of new homes in china fell for the ninth consecutive month in may showing that the property sector continues to be a major drag on the world s second largest economy average house prices in china s 70 major cities fell by 61 so far this year with a very large inventory of unsold property weighing on the market the property sector accounts for about 20 of china s economy and is now considered one of china s biggest risks to economic growth the recent rate reductions may help stimulate demand but some economists are calling for a much bigger rate reduction to at least 2 in order to recover demand there

input periods that are open on the 8th july 2015 will end on that date with the next period running from the 9th july 2015 to the 6th april 2016 pension savings for pension input periods ending in 201516 will be split into two mini tax years depending on whether they ended before the 9th july 2015 or in a postbudget pension input period which will run from 9th july 2015 and end on 5th april 2016 for all pension input periods ending on or after 6 april 2015 and on or before 8th july 2015 individuals will have an annual allowance of PS80000 plus available carry forward pension savings from 9th july 2015 to the 5th april 2016 will have a nil annual allowance but up to PS40000 of any unused annual allowance for the period up to 8th july 2015 is added to this in addition to any remaining carry forward from the previous three tax years annual allowance changes for april 201617 the government is pushing ahead with its manifesto pledge to reduce the tax relief for people earning more than PS150000 their annual allowance will reduce by 50p for every PS1 of income in a range between PS150000 and PS210000 so that someone with an income of PS210000 or more will have an annual allowance of PS10000 the government consults on the future of pension tax relief pension tax relief rules are complex complexity acts as a disincentive if people cannot understand the benefit of saving for their later life the 12week consultation does not put forward a specific proposal for reform instead it is seeking suggestions about whether and how the current system of pension tax relief should be reformed it is not proposing incentives for pension savings are scrapped altogether quite the opposite instead it wants to ensure that the incentives to save for retirement are clear simple and transparent ensuring that individuals make sufficient savings for later life any change will not occur overnight and the government is clear that it will proceed gradually taxation of lump sum death benefits from april 2015 pension savings can be paid out taxfree if a member died before age 75 and the lump sum was paid within two years of the member s death but a 45 tax charge applies if the lump sum is paid after two years or in respect of a member who died after age 75 from april 2016 the tax payable on lump sums paid after two years or post age 75 will be based on the marginal rate of the recipient with the exception of lump sums paid to nonindividuals like trusts or companies for which the rate will remain at 45  barriers to accessing pension freedoms  the government will consult imminently on options to improve the pension transfer process aiming to make it quicker and smoother they confirm that if there is evidence of exit penalties hindering the process they will act by legislating a cap on early exit penalties for those aged 55 or over pension wise access for age 50 upwards the government is extending access to pension wise the free and impartial guidance service to those aged 50 and above having received criticism that pension wise is not widely known a nationwide marketing campaign will be launched to raise awareness secondary annuity market delayed until 2017 the government confirmed the secondary annuity market enabling consumers to sell their annuities for a lump sum will be delayed until 2017 this is to ensure sufficient time to create a market and support service to ensure consumers are making the right decision plans for the secondary annuity market will be set out in the autumn  changes to domicile rules permanent nondomicile status to be abolished the chancellor has today announced changes to the deemed domicile rules which are due to apply from april 2017 a detailed consultation document will be published after the summer recess on the best way to deliver these reforms further consultation will follow on the draft legislation which is intended to form part of the 2016 finance bill deemed domicile from 6 april 2017 irrespective of when someone arrived in the uk those who have been resident in the uk for 15 out of the past 20 the 15 year rule tax years will be treated as deemed uk domiciled for all tax purposes this means that they will no longer be able to use the remittance basis of taxation and will be deemed domicile for iht purposes therefore someone who has already been in the uk for 15 years and remains in the uk from the 6 april 2017 will be caught by the new regime and be unable to access the remittance basis the government will consult on whether split years of uk residence will count towards the 15 year rule once a nondomicile has become deemed domicile under the 15 year rule and spends more than 5 years outside the uk at that point they will lose their deemed domicile status the five year rule this is likely only to be relevant for iht purposes however there is an increase in the inheritance tax tail from the 6 april 2017 as currently this would only be relevant for four years those who had a domicile in the uk at the date of their birth will revert to having a uk domicile for tax purposes whenever they are resident in the uk even if under general law they acquired a domicile in another country domicile of choice changes in order to align the treatment of uk domiciles and nondomiciles uk domiciles who leave after 5 april 2017 having been in the uk for more than 15 years will also be subject to the five year rule even if they intend to emigrate permanently and settle in a particular place on the day of departure the government will consult on the interactions between the new five year rule and existing three and four year rules excluded property trusts and nondomiciles the technical note issued as part of the summer budget documents technical briefing on non dom changes announced at summer budget 2015 confirmed that the use of excluded property trusts will have the same iht treatment as at present except for the 15 out of 20 rule other than the announcement made in relation to uk residential property see below however such longterm residents will from april 2017 be taxed on any benefits capital or income received from any trusts on a worldwide basis the government recognises that this is a significant change to the current rules and that changes to trust taxation are complex and will therefore consult on the necessary details we await the detail of these proposals non dom uk dom consultation the government intends to consult further on the interaction of the various deemed domicile rules for both uk domiciles and nondomiciles

change will not apply to any other uk assets and neither does it change the rules regarding nonuk assets tax avoidance and tax evasion tackling offshore evasion this is relevant for financial institutions tax advisers and other professionals that may be aware of or may have given advice in respect of an offshore account the government will legislate in the summer finance bill 2015 to amend

all the financial news has been focused upon a solution for the greek debt crisis the referendum in greece followed by the financial and political negotiations in brussels has keep this current greek tragedy on the front pages however a bigger drama has been playing out while being virtually unreported in the uk until this week and that is the spectacular growth and then fall in chinese stock markets the financial and investment implications of the events in shanghai are far more important to the world economy than those of greece to put the economies in context china has 20 cities that are bigger than the whole of greece and an economy 40 times larger the fall in chinese share prices in june were 13 times the size of the greek economy the knock on impact of the chinese stock market losing a third of its value is far more significant the rebalancing of the chinese economy from investment and export driven towards domestic consumption is a key pillar of the beijing reform programme part of this programme was the ongoing promotion by the chinese authorities of property and equity markets in order to create growth and a feel good factor within china the outcome has been millions of inexperienced private investors pushing up chinese stocks creating a bubble that has spectacularly burst the chinese government were encouraging equity investment right up to the point the market corrected this has made policy makers look inept in august 2014 the shanghai composite index stood at 2177 and by early june 2015 had grown 237 to 5166 seven weeks later it stood at 3725 a fall of 28 including an 85 decline suffered on 27th july this was the sharpest one day fall for eight years despite the chinese government trying to support the market this fall sent tremors around the global commodity markets and hit currency values even with these recent falls the shanghai composite index is up 170 over one year and up 96 since january there is however concern that the communist party is losing control of their economy having stoked up a series of asset bubbles first in residential property and then equities in order to keep up the pace of economic growth the chinese stabilisation measures adopted since the first big sell off in june did not work commentators think that the chinese authorities have put a lot of credibility on the line to shore up prices and this credibility has been damaged the government has already bought 250 bn chinese equities and has a credit line of 450 bn if necessary they have also adopted measures to close the market ban short selling and forced brokerage houses to buy stock unfortunately this is leading to a false market building up unnecessary stress clearly markets need to settle at levels that can be sustained on fundamental reasons which may well mean the chinese state swallowing some heavy losses for the rest of the world the events in china have much bearing china consumes 50 of global coal 43 of industrial metals and 23 of world grain the dangers posed specifically by the chinese stock market falls may well have been over stated the main concern is the slowing of the real economy and the impact that a lack of chinese spending is having on the rest of the world particularly the bric economies as it happens the chinese stock market is not that significant in relation to china s real economy as for decades the stock market has not mirrored the nations gdp growth only 1 in 30 chinese people own shares as compared to 1 in 7 in the usa for all the 100 million stock broking accounts in shanghai most are owned by the wealthy and who are unlikely to scale back spending due to stock market falls there is an inevitable slowing in the rate of growth as a result of china s new higher level of development the fall off from 142 pa gdp growth in 2007 to about 68 this year is in line with the experience of other asian countries like japan taiwan and south korea however unlike most western countries the chinese authorities have plenty of options to support their economy they have already cut interest rates four times so far this year but still have room to cut further if need be their current bank lending rate is 485 far higher than that of the west the nation s banks are still in public ownership and so if the economy were to weaken the authorities could instruct the banks to keep lending if china is to become a normal economy and realise its full economic potential then the share of the economy based upon private consumption needs to rise from the current 38 in order for this to happen the share taken up by investment and exports will need to fall this is a great challenge to chinese prime minister li keqiang as and when china becomes a consumer society it will have a huge impact on the world if we just consider tourism a growing industry for chinese travellers currently travel out of china by the chinese exceeds arrivals into china by 4 to 1 even though only 1 in 20 chinese have a passport ever since last autumn when chinese stock markets were beginning their bull run there have been warnings of a bubble having now corrected fair value has been restored after the momentum speculation of millions of private investors we feel that this new fair value could continue to grow for many years but not without some bumps along the way as stated before we remain

	(133,'node',' investment the week the world realised that deflation was a global threat investment the week the world realised that deflation was a global threat   1 day ago from september 2014 through to june 2015 we witnessed a remarkable stock market boom in china this bull run was supported by the further opening of the chinese stock market to international investment and by the chinese authority s encouragement of domestic investment the shanghai composite index started september priced at 2200 points rising to 5166 in midjune prior to the first market correction over the past 8 weeks the index has fallen back to 3232 the level at which it started 2015 on 11th august the peoples bank of china pboc released the yuan from its us peg and devalued the currency by around 2 the pboc s action followed a report confirming an 8 drop in chinese exports and was directly aimed at increasing export demand and improving job creation the implication of this devaluation was that china s economy needed the assistance of a lower exchange rate which caused shock waves in world markets it was the day that the world realized that deflation was a global threat many commentators were taken aback by this move as the devaluation came at the same time as falling stock markets and a major sell off in commodity prices the exchange rate reduction immediately created fears of a currency and export war which could see competing countries racing to weaken their currencies driving prices lower and hitting company profits the shanghai composite index suffered its worse one day fall since 2007 loosing 85 on black monday 24th august and then fell a further 76 the next day both of these falls came immediately after a week when the index had already lost 115 of its value the shock of these loses spread across the world hitting all markets and whipped out all the gains the shanghai index has made during 2015 the dow jones index fell 1000 points and the ftse 100 lost 47 of its value these dramatic declines represented uncertainty fear of deflation and panic selling the fact this happened in august a holiday month where trade levels are low only made the percentages bigger western markets have bounced back with stocks recovering most of the week s earlier losses by friday 28th the ftse 100 was back to 6247 having dropped to 5898 the chinese authorities must take their share of the blame they actively stoked up stock market mania in shanghai expecting a growing equity market could reflate the chinese economy since the start of the collapse beijing has taken action to stabilise the market they have tightening rules on short selling banning large shareholders from offloading stock and forcing national pension funds to buy domestic stock despite these high handed anti open market tactics or even because of them the shanghai index fell still further the falls came to an end when the pboc stepped in with an interest rate cut of 25 reducing borrowing costs to 46 the events of the last two weeks have been some of the most dramatic of the last seven years with stock market losses around the world flying in the face of a slow but evident global recovery what is more the vast majority of economists investment professionals and commentators did not see this coming it is clear that overvalued stock prices were suddenly hit by the reality of slowing economic growth and the threat of deflation fear of deflation was the result of slowing growth falling commodity prices and the devaluation in the yuan these events cause deflationary pressure which is the last thing a fragile global recovery needs if beijing was to further support its export and domestic job market with further devaluation then the fear of deflation will intensify hitting markets further the devaluing of a currency exchange at the same time as cutting interest rates as the chinese authorities have done four times this year does have dangerous consequences particularly in inviting outflows of capital us 800bn has already left china this year with us 200bn fleeing in july the pboc holds us 37tr in foreign currency reserves by far the world s largest and is burning through these reserves in order to defend its currency there has been real fear expressed that beijing has in some way lost control of its plan to manage its objectives of solid growth while also deflating its credit bubble the recent performance of the stock market should not however be mistaken for the performance of china s real economy only 3 of china s population own shares so market losses will not directly affect many beijing has certainly made mistakes over trying to control stock market speculation but it does still have a sound grip on the economy there is no doubt that china is slowing official figures has put gdp growth at 68 however many economists consider actual growth at about 45 pa and even this lower growth rate does not justify panic if china manages a smooth transition to a slower more sustainable economy it is still likely to be fast enough to raise chinese living standards and domestic consumption to achieve this many economists are calling for a major blast of fiscal spending in response the chinese government plans to pull forward a raft of spending plans scheduled for 2016 which come on top of a 13 increase in government spending for q4 china industrial sector has slowed this year but there is not a sign of a slump industrial output has increased by 6 and retail sales up an encouraging 105 this year looser monetary policy takes longer to take effect in china than it does in western economies so this year s interest rate reductions are starting to come through china s service sector which is now bigger than its manufacturing sector is looking healthy the property sector is improving house prices have risen for the past three months and sales are up 189 year on year to july this is particularly important as the housing market and its related industries comprise 25 of chinese gdp house sales values in the largest 44 cities are up 34 in the first half of 2015 compared to 2014 land acquisition is up a massive 92 on 2014 and construction startups up 52 the lowering of interest rates this year has aided this growth the general consensus is that the situation in china is manageable particularly if beijing accepts the cost and pain of stock market losses and moves swiftly to deal with any bad debt that could spiral in china due to capital outflows and a slowing economy fortunately china has a great deal of slack in the system to fall back on it has far more scope to act than western economies through major spending projects foreign currency reserves and interest rate cuts the economy can still benefit from

future generations an in out referendum on the uk membership of the eu will take place by the end of 2017 but possibly as early as the summer of 2016 this referendum will be very important and may not be that far away our decision will have far reaching economic impact affecting ourselves and future generations the key foundation of the eu is the single market one which promotes the freedom of movement of goods services people and capital the underlying belief is that a single market helps to underpin prosperity by fostering competition and ensuring efficient allocation of resources the single market is assisted by the use of a single currency in 19 of the 28 member states despite these founding principles the process of creating a single market in all sectors of the economy is by no means complete the euro has been under stain for several years and recently the free movement of labour has also come under pressure passport and border controls have been abolished in the schengen area which comprises of 22 of the eu member countries along with iceland lichtenstein norway and switzerland however germany has recently brought back border controls with austria after large numbers of migrants from war torn syrian travelled from hungary via austria into south germany the uk along with ireland negotiated to opt out of the schengen area the uk currently accounts for 125 of the eu population and 15 of its gdp we import 93 of eu imports and export 63 of all eu exports we are the fourth largest net contributor to the eu budget after germany france and italy in the last financial year 201415 the uk s net payment after rebates and eu receipts was PS9bn about 46 of uk gdp it is expected to stay at PS9bn for the next few years some exponents of a uk exit from the eu claimed in september 2013 that the true cost of eu membership is somewhat different the full indirect costs were assessed and they overshadow the direct costs substantially if added to the direct costs the cost of lost jobs due to immigration waste regulation resource misallocation fraud and corruption that would mean that the figure rises to a massive 11 of gdp these figures are as one might expect disputed by the pro eu campaign it should be remembered that these costs do bring benefits to the uk and balancing the two is the assessment that needs to be made in order to come to a reasoned judgement the share of uk trade with the eu has been declining in recent years but it is still our largest trade partner just over 45 of uk exports went to the eu while 50 of imports came the other way in 201415 the uk has a growing trade deficit with eu countries but a growing trade surplus with non eu countries an argument is often made that the uk is hampered in taking advantage of trade outside the eu by virtue of the fact that the eu negotiate on behalf of all members the trade and tariff terms with the rest of the world the strength of the uk trade with non eu countries may counter that argument in the 10 years prior to the uk joining the eu in 1973 the uk gdp per capita was weaker than the average of the eu it has been consistently stronger than the rest since membership in 1973 according to thomson reuters it therefore seems hard to argue that membership has effected growth the conservative government s objective appears to be to secure enough changes in eu law regulation and practise that would enable the prime minister to go to the country with the proposal that the changes negotiated would change the character of the eu sufficiently to justify continued british membership the changes sought are in four main areas first a curb on the rights of immigrant workers to receive uk welfare payments a four year waiting period before in work benefits are available and the removal of jobseekers benefits if not in work are the conditions sought germany and spain are both seeking similar tightening up of immigrant benefit entitlement progress on this issue seems possible secondly the uk wants to be excluded from the eu objective of ever closer union other eu members outside the eurozone are sympathetic to this objective by contrast the members of the eurozone do need ever closer union if the eurozone is to avoid the kind of crisis that has bedevilled the currency over the past five years thirdly the uk is seeking general improvement in the overall competitiveness of the eu including greater cost cutting and accountability germany is particularly sympathetic to this cause fourthly ministers are concerned that the 19 eurozone countries will use majority voting in the 28 member eu to change rules to the detriment of noneuro nations this is especially relevant to financial regulation and the city of london the uk is seeking binding principles to ensure this does not happen unfortunately for mr cameron any new rules have to be part of treaties and will not be completed before the uk goes to the polls there are a range of brexit scenarios all with different implications to the uk economy in september 2015 four economic studies from independent research institutions made predictions that leaving the eu would have a negative impact on uk gdp growth each of the studies used different time periods but all had a similar conclusion financial markets are for the time being ignoring the risk of a brexit as so much is still yet to be negotiated apart from by the end of 2017 there is little indication as to when the referendum will take place and which post brexit option the government would take morgan stanley has recently published a 75 page report modelling the impact of the referendum on the uk economy they have called a 35 probability of a leave vote and a 50 probability of a very close vote they also predict that uk growth would fall to 1 in

	(149,'node',' investment the challenges of global demographics investment the challenges of global demographics   16 hours ago the great recession of 2008 has led to record peacetime government budget deficits across the developed world these massive debt piles have highlighted to governments the cost of generous pension and welfare benefit arrangements enacted decades earlier the impact of the great recession was to erase PS trillions in private wealth around the world leaving many with insufficient assets to fully realise the comfortable retirement that they had once expected against a backdrop of people living longer and the current retired generation benefiting more than any before there is a sense that the relative standards of living will fall for the next and subsequent generations there are some key factors that will influence whether these senses become a reality the first of these factors is the unprecedented rise in the number of people across the developed world that will enter retirement and the impact that this will have on government spending on health and pensions the second factor is who will produce the goods and services in sufficient quantity that these retirees will consume and who will purchase the assets that they may wish to sell to finance their retirement it has been shown that if the developed world wishes to maintain their current retirement ages then they will not be able to rely on their own working population alone to produce the goods they require an offsetting force is the strong growth in the more advanced emerging economies of india china and other asian countries they will soon provide the bulk of the world output the challenge over economic growth and demographics is whether the emerging economies will be productive enough to produce the goods and services to generate sufficient savings to purchase assets from the developed world s new retirees between 1946 and 1964 birth rates significantly rose above the average of the previous two decades the so called baby boomers were then followed by a baby bust in europe for example average birth rates fell from 25 in 1960 to 18 in 2010 in the mediterranean countries it fell below 15 in asia the birth rate per family is even lower in japan and south korea it is 13 and in china it is of course just 1 china has recently ended its one child policy research at cambridge university has illustrated that since 1840 life expectancy in the developed world has increase at a constant rate of 25 years per decade the improvement in mortality rates among the baby boomers combined with the reduction in birth rates has dramatically changed the age distribution of the worlds advanced economies by 2040 the age profile of japan greece spain and portugal will be inverted the heaviest population bracket will be people in their 70 s and 80 s with the number over 80 outnumbering children aged under 15 through the western world there has been a trend of reducing retirement ages the combined forces of rising life expectancy and falling retirement age will result in a dramatic rise in the number of years the average worker is retired an increase in retired life is particularly significant as millions of people across the developed world expect to enjoy general good health supported by income benefits provided by the state corporations or privately this golden age of increased life expectancy and early retirement cannot continue as we know in the uk basic state pension ages have already been raised to age 65 for both sexes and then moving both to 66 and then 68 statistics from 2013 show that the usa has 28 retires per 100 workers this is expected to rise to 56 per 100 by 2060 in japan it is 49 per 100 but rising to 113 per 100 by 2060 across europe the 2060 figure is predicted to be 76 per 100 workers these predictions assume a 65 retirement age with the exception of china the rise in the number of retirees in the emerging economies is much more gradual between 2015 and 2033 when the vast majority of baby boomers in developed economies will have retired the number of retirees per 100 workers will have risen from 11 today to only 18 this age wave of baby boomers in retirement may have a negative impact on asset values in the future an increase of retirees could generate an increase in sellers over buyers a situation that could only depress asset prices the impact being that future retirees will have to work longer and save more currently about 80 of the world s population live in developing countries these economies currently produce about 50 of the world s output but this is changing since the 1980 s the per capital production of the chinese economy as measures as a against us per capita production has risen from a starting point of 21 china has four times the population of us and will become the world s largest economy when the per capital income reaches 25 this is forecast to happen in 2016 the economy of china is expected to be twice the size of that of the usa by 2025 if both countries per capita income continues as they are the growth in china s gdp is projected to produce 32 of world output by 2032 but then falling back to 14 by the end of the century this decline is put down to the one child policy and the long term implications a decade after china started to grow so started india s economic liberalisation it is expected that india s gdp growth will surpass china s this year india s gdp is predicted to exceed the us in the mid 2030 s and eventually exceed china india journey is quite remarkable it accounted for 3 of world gdp back in 1980 but now produces 6 of global output it is forecast to grow to 11 by 2032 by 2060 india s economy is expected to be larger than china because of population growth and age demographics india is predicted to produce about 25 of world gdp by 2040 and maintain that output through the rest of this century research by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd has estimated that the middle class as defined as people earning between us 3650 and us 36500 per annum in emerging economies will increase by more than 3 billion or 170 between 2015 and 2030 while their spending power will increase by 150 rising to over us 34 tn this is twice the size of the us economy and 80 of that growth is expected in asia in contrast the oecd expects that total spending in western europe and usa will barely increase over the same timescale the growth of the emerging economies has profound and beneficial implications for the developed world over the decades ahead many of the goods required by the retirees of the developed world will be produced by workers in emerging markets the income earned from selling these goods will support workers savings asian s are natural high savers with high national savings ratios the growth of savings by investors in both developed and emerging economies may result in baby boomers

majority of smaller emerging markets until the impact of us interest rate rise has been assessed as well as a return to commodity demand in the short term we expect returns on government bonds to be reasonable particularly if further ecb qe suppresses yields and supports prices credit risk and liquidity has improved in europe there is some concern over high yield defaults in the us and reduced liquidity in this asset class in general for this reason we remain cautious and underweight in corporate bonds and high yield bonds with inflation expectations still some way off we prefer fixed rate over index linked gilts the general strategy for 2016 is to hold some short dated corporate bond funds to negate the us interest rate rise we remain negative on commodities and commodity producing countries such as russia and brazil mainly due to an ongoing lack of demand and their overall dependence upon china the level of oil production is starting to be controlled by the major opec countries which should put support behind the current oil price since the summer the brent crude oil price has consistently stayed below us 50pb this low oil price does however continue to support consumer

sensitive to any signs that china may abandon its defence of the renminbi while any currency war would damage global growth   17 hours ago 2016 is only one week old and has already made headlines for having been one of the worst starts to a new year in global capital markets some of the trends of 2015 continue with falling commodity prices particularly oil and concerns over the state of the chinese economy and the chinese government s ability to manage its currency adjustment the falls of 10 in the chinese stock market last week caught may investors and analysts by surprise the months running up to christmas where showing signs of a strengthening world economy with some improving economic data 2016 looked like a year able to provide better returns than the highly volatile 2015 for example the markit purchase managers index pmi across the world was showing an increase in confidence however just as we saw last summer china s volatile stock market has spooked investors around the world a key question is whether investors have overreacted to reasons for the falls the first week of trading was affected by lower than expected chinese manufacturing pmi data for december the index fell from its prechristmas levels indicating a fall in confidence another factor effecting stock market sentiment was the end to a ban on selling shares by major chinese shareholders this was not an issue about the state of the economy but shareholders taking profit from the autumn rally when they had the chance to perhaps the most concerning event was the chines central bank allowing the renminbi to devalue against the us the peoples bank of china pbc reduced its daily rate for the renminbi by 5 which is the largest downward move since last augusts 2 devaluation that devaluation resulted in major stock market losses the pcb later hinted that it could allow the renminbi us exchange rate to be determined by the market the implication of china devaluing its currency in response to other central banks that have devalued their own currencies through rate reductions or quantitative easing qe is one of global deflation in december the chinese authorities spent us 120bn of their foreign currency reserves this is massive state intervention to defend the exchange rate the intervention sought to protect the renminbi against the ever strengthening us and stem capital outflows from china chinese foreign currency reserves have fallen from us 4tn to us 333tn they are using up their reserves at an alarming rate and are getting closer to the us 26tn deemed by the international monetary fund imf to be the prudent level given china s us 12tn domestic liabilities and the size of its economy at current spending rates china has six months before china s once mighty arsenal of capital looks a little inadequate the authorities are caught between monetary tightening which is the result of selling reserves and maintain the strength of its currency global markets are acutely sensitive to any signs that china may abandon its defence of the renminbi while any currency war would damage global growth the chinese stock market is largely uncorrelated to the real china economy when the stock market doubled in value last year only then to give up those gains neither really represented the real chinese economy chinese gdp growth is largely unchanged we know the economy is inevitable slowing but it is not coming to a haul the old manufacturing heartlands are in decline but the service sector new economies remain strong china is about both of these sectors the transition from export to investment led consumption is progressing but clearly not smoothly this progress can offer excellent investment opportunities for stock pickers but these opportunities are currently being undermined by a lack of confidence in the overall economy and competence of the chinese authorities markets have taken the december rise in us interest rates very well and the rise has in turn strengthen the us any currency devaluation will increase the relative value of us and as commodities are priced in us will impact on commodity prices there is a general expectation that the federal reserve open markets committee will progressively increase us interest rates by small increments throughout 2016 starting perhaps in march or june however any slowing of the global recovery may have the effect of delaying such increases one aspect of the us economy that is proving resilient is the level of new jobs being created the us added 292000 new jobs in december which was significantly higher than economists had predicted in 2015 265 million new jobs were created and is evidence of the growing strength of the us recovery the fed is expecting new job growth to continue throughout 2016 with janet yellen suggesting that the us may create full employment by 2017 these job growth figures are a vindication to the federal reserve s much debated decision to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade oil has hit its lowest price per barrel at us 32 since april 2002 the falls are due to a lack of global growth resulting in reduced demand and a massive oversupply in the market the renewed tensions between iran and saudi arabia would have in the past put pressure on oil prices this time there appears to be an expectation that rather than hostilities in the middle east the more likely outcome is the intensification of the oil price war further undermining opec s price cartel saudi arabia currency the riyal came under pressure last week as the price of oil fell to a us 32pb any devaluation of the riyal could spark a wave of deflation and protectionist policies within the global economy saudi arabia is the world largest producer of crude oil and has a war chest of foreign currency reserves to use to defend its currency however the falling price of oil has seen these reserves fall from us 732 last year down to us 623 indicating the cost of maintaining high oil production and a low oil price investment bank goldman sachs has warned that despite beijing s efforts to prop up their currency the pbc may be forced to abandon its support and allow devaluation just as the us and europe sought to recover from the financial crisis through currency devaluation reduced interest rates and quantitative easing the fear is now that even the mighty china with its massive foreign currency reserves may need to do the same the implications are significant to world markets as currency devaluation will create deflation but reduced interest rates and qe will support real

said that the world could drown in oversupply now that iranian crude returns to the market the ensuing rush to sell on world markets created a dynamic of its own which is hard to gauge and even harder to rationalise many economists have commented upon the herd like mentality effecting investors which pushes down asset prices and which itself becomes counterproductive and selffulfilling the outlook is unusually uncertain but if we do step back there is no real change in the already known growth patterns of the usa and china and that low oil prices are usually good for consumers manufacturing and transport many uk companies across differing sectors are voicing concern over whether they will hit their earnings forecasts and as a consequence issuing warnings of a downgrade in profits business particularly the energy sector is being affected by a cocktail of uncertainty over the falling oil prices slowing chinese growth and any further rises in us interest rates despite the recent announcement of chinese gdp growth officially falling to 69 in 2015 from 73 in 2014 china still consumed 1032 million barrels of oil last year chinese oil use rose by 25 and even with growth likely to fall chinese demand for crude oil is set to grow by 15 this coming year therefore it is not a lack of chinese demand that is hitting the oil price the annual world economic forum in davos gives economists business leaders and world institutions a chance to discuss the economic expectations for the year ahead interestingly even after the stock market volatility in recent weeks most delegates still expect a continuation of gradual economic expansion and see a low likelihood of a market crash one attendee that did not share this view was george soros the billionaire currency trader warned of financial turmoil a hard landing for debt laden china and the spread of deflation markets gained some much needed relief at the end of last week with the belief that central banks will now provide some fresh support on tuesday after the chinese gdp growth figures for 2015 were announced the chinese authorities confirmed their awareness of the formidable challenges ahead of them in order to rebalance their economy and their determination to fully address these issues with large parts of the chinese economy still state owned as well as the entire banking system the country has the means to control a gradual slowdown much does depend upon how well china manages its slowdown the imf has recently reassessed its growth forecasts and confirmed that its estimate for chinese gdp growth in 2016 will remain at 63 china was one of the few countries not to be given a growth downgrade for 2016 on thursday at the european central bank ecb monthly press conference president mario draghi hinted that the ecb would expand their monetary easing program from march onwards if market action lead to deterioration in the economic outlook the ecb inflation target is 2 pa and is currently running at 2 way below this target back in december mr draghi said he expected eurozone inflation to reach 1 in 2016 he made this prediction assuming oil would be priced at an average of us 50pb and it now stands below us 30pb mr draghi comments last week were interpreted as meaning that the ecb will take further action over quantitative easing to stimulate inflation and counter the fall in oil price his comments calmed the stock market with shares rising across the world on friday major stocks markets gained between 2 and 6 the reaction to the announcements by the peoples bank of china pbc and the ecb indicates that the markets are concerned that central banks may be misjudging the continued fragility of economic expansion and have tightened monetary conditions prematurely world stock markets have been particularly turbulent since the us federal reserve increased us interest rates in december and perhaps that is no coincidence after initially responding positively to the rise european investment bank ubs has suggested that the federal reserve must also come out and reassure the markets ubs feels that the fed needs to cool expectations of how quickly it will move in delivering successive rate rises this would send a positive message to the market as further rate rises would be damaging all eyes are therefore on janet yellen to see what the federal reserve s response will be we see there being three key headwinds in 2016 namely the deflationary impact of falling commodity prices the credit stress in emerging markets following the us interest rate rise and the slowdown in china and the currency control of the renminbi coordinated reassurances by the major central banks that they will manage monetary policy with close regard to these challenges is essential by the end of last week there was a noticeable change in investor mood many technical indicators moved from sell to buy with investors sensing a barging in the january sales with markets so depressed we therefore hope we have seen an end of this correction the change in pulse has made us more confident of a market recovery if the selloff in early january was psychologically driven rather than reflect the fundamentals of the global economy prices should rebound as they did last october after augusts sell off we do however remain cautious particularly over the implications of a slowing china and the levels of capital leaving the country this is placing strong downward pressure on the renminbi any resultant devaluation will transfer deflation to the west via lower import prices

even dr yellen s comments did little to support markets as traders around the world sold off stock last week had an eerie feel of last august about it when fears over china s currency and stock market spilled into the rest of the world s markets we see traders sell down prices not because of a significant change in the fundamentals but a fear of the unknown analysts are putting the falls down to falling oil prices slowing growth in china spikes in the value of the Y and weak us economic data realistically none of these issues alone should account for the level of losses the concerns over the stability of european banks may well have been the actual trigger this was centred on the prospect of negative interest rates and the bearish sentiment of the general state of europe s banking system the pressure centred on germany s largest bank deutsche bank the banks credit default swaps which value the cost of insuring the bank against bankruptcy hit levels not seen since the 2012 euro crisis with global growth stalling it is inevitable that banks will be under scrutiny with markets increasingly worried about central banks ongoing ability to continue to stimulate growth the negative interest rates imposed by several central banks including japan and sweden are making it more difficult for retail banks to build capital reserves and make profit from lending banks earn much of their profits from lending at higher rates than they borrow at but at zero interest rates there is less scope for this with central banks charging retail banks for parking their cash banks are loath to pass this cost onto customers instead they are charging more for lending which is then tightening credit deutsche bank saw it shares fall by 15 early last week but then bounced back by 12 on wednesday after wolfgang schaeuble germany s finance minister said he had no concerns about deutsche and that deutsche bank paid back EU3bn of euro bonds and 2bn of dollar bonds to relieve market worries while deutsche bank may be making substantial losses it is nowhere close to triggering a write down of its contingent convertible bonds and that in this case investors got a severe case of the jitters european banks are stress tested by the european central bank ecb but not as rigorously as the bank of england boe has done in the uk mainly as there are so many more banking institutions to regulate however unlike their american counterparts european banks still hold some bad debt festering on their balance sheets in the past the ecb has supported the european banks with repeated injections of liquidity to keep even the poorer banks afloat now the reality of negative interest rates is making them face a commercial reality and force them to restructure their businesses comments from germany s bankers generally do not believe that the wider economy is in trouble yet but do fear that panic can spread in a selffulfilling way they feel that a panic can hurt the short term outlook even if the fundamentals do not really justify such damage a useful counterpoint to the concerns of a down turn was the release of january s forward looking purchase managers index pmi figures for many countries and sectors the pmi is a snapshot of business expectations with readings over 50 indicating a positive outlook results for the developed world averaged 521 while the emerging world averaged 493 with brazil and russia in particular bringing down the numbers developed markets seem to be continuing on their path of healing led by solid performances in the service sector while those emerging markets mainly exposed to commodity exports have experienced a real slowdown these pmi results are at similar levels to q4 of 2015 before the recent market falls and indicates that in the real economy not that much has changed and certainly nothing that would justify the selloff we witnessed last week another important change is that the markets over the past three weeks appear to have taken seriously the major central banks resolve to keep economic expansion on track last week this manifested itself in a fall in the us while the chinese renminbi gained leading to an upward movement in commodity and oil prices by the end of the week the majority of markets had enjoyed a relief rally and put back on 25 to 3 a sense of calm may have descended upon global markets following a punishing week that

from the help to buy isa going forward if you have both types of isa you cannot use the government bonus from both accounts to put towards your first house purchase the government is going to explore with the industry whether there should be the flexibility to borrow funds from the lifetime isa without incurring a charge if the borrowed funds are fully repaid in the us for example some retirement plans allow 50 to be borrowed up to a maximum of 50000 legislation for the lifetime isa is expected in the autumn following engagement with the industry isa tax advantages during the administration of

allowance to reduce from PS1250000 to PS1000000 a member of a registered pension scheme can currently crystallise up to a value of PS1250000 lifetime allowance and not be subject to any additional tax charges usually 25 of the payment can be taken taxfree with the balance taxable as income this limit for the lifetime allowance will reduce to PS1000000 in 201617 the lifetime allowance is currently scheduled to begin to rise in line with the consumers prices index cpi from 6042018 fixed protection 2016 and individual protection 2016 as applied in previous tax years when the lifetime allowance was reduced the government is introducing new forms of protection for those close to the current lifetime allowance there will be two new forms of protection individual protection 2016 fixed protection 2016 tapered annual allowance for anyone who has not triggered the money purchase annual allowance the standard annual allowance will be PS40000 however for higher earners the annual allowance will be reduced if a member s threshold income is above PS110000 and their adjusted income is above PS150000 the annual allowance reduction is PS1 for every PS2 that the adjusted income exceeds PS150000 subject to a maximum reduction of PS30000 ie an annual allowance of PS10000 if a client has any unused annual allowance from any of the previous three tax years this can also be carried forward   changes to death benefit taxation if a member of a registered pension scheme rps dies a on or after their 75th birthday and b the death benefit is not paid to a uk charity within two years of the date that the scheme administrator became aware of the member s death any payment to a qualifying person ie an individual in their own capacity would be taxed at the recipient s marginal income tax rate s using the pay as you earn paye system  pensions tax relief no change to the existing pension tax relief system announced but we don t think further reform is off the table permanently a new lifetime isa has been announced but does not seem to impact the current pension s tax regime however it may lead to younger individuals without a mortgage opting out of their automatic enrolment scheme in favour of saving for their first property salary sacrifice the government confirmed that income tax and national insurance contribution relief provided through salary sacrifice will continue for pension savings and other benefits for example childcare and healthrelated benefits however it may restrict the range of other benefits that can be provided through salary sacrifice arrangements this is a sensible approach and is good news for working families and pension savers serious illhealth lump sum sihls taxation the government will alter the tax treatment of a sihls to bring it into line with the way that lump sum death benefits are taxed this means a sihls will be taxfree when someone aged under 75 has less than a year to live but has already accessed their pension a sihls will be taxable at the member s marginal income tax rate s if the member is aged at least 75 corporation tax corporation tax will be reduced to 17 in 2020  stamp duty land tax

they are resident for 15 of the past 20 tax years and individuals who were born in the uk and have a uk domicile of origin will revert to uk domiciled status for tax purposes whilst they are resident in the uk no additional announcements were made in this budget legislation for these changes will be introduced in 2017 and include charges to uk inheritance tax on uk residential property held from april 2017 in an offshore structure such as a trust tax avoidance and tax evasion the government will issue a number of consultations in the summer of 2017 which propose introducing the principle that the issuance of licenses and access to services be conditional on being registered for tax in the uk additionally a new legal requirement will be introduced in 2017 to correct past offshore noncompliance tough sanctions will be introduced for those who do not make such correction news ',0),
	(190,'node',' investment the birth of lisa investment the birth of lisa   7 min ago after last week s budget there are a few things we have learnt about chancellors george osbornes intentions over key tax and financial planning matters it is clear that after all the media comment and rumour on the changes to higher rate tax relief on pension contributions that where subsequently dropped that mr osborne is not finished on pension reform the significant rise in the annual isa allowance to PS20000 is interesting isa are popular and simple and this rise is a welcome particularly to those high earners who will suffer a reduction in their annual pension allowance from PS40000 down to PS10000 this year however it is the lifetime isa lisa that is more interesting if you are a 20 tax payer the PS100 tax you get back for every PS400 invested makes the lisa tax free on the way in and on the way out we think we can expect mr osborne to progressively expand the lisa so that it becomes for the under 40 s the first choice for savings the chancellors desire to avoid paying out higher rate relief on pensions will be aided by the popularity of the new lisa the under 40 s may prefer a lisa to a pension in their early saving years and therefore not start a pension until they are in their 40 s this may have a significant impact on early and important pension savings and workplace pensions for those under 40 now thinking about accessing a pension fund at age 55 this may change with the new lisa only being available at age 60 unless it is used to purchase a home it is likely that the access age for both will become 60 news ',0),
